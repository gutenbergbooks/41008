<p>This second monograph on the great
American canals which played the
part of important highways westward,
is devoted to an outline of the Erie
Canal. In the comparatively short space
at our disposal for so great a theme, it has
been possible only to sketch some of the
leading features of our subject, namely,
the early history of the Mohawk Valley
route, the origin of the canal idea, its
building, the celebration of its completion,
a catalogue of its finances and enlargements,
and its effect.</p>

<p>Our sources have been the state <i>Reports</i>,
Sweet&rsquo;s <i>Documentary History</i>, Hawley&rsquo;s
<i>Origin of the Erie Canal</i>, and the various
state and local histories which treat of the
subject. A monograph, in the form of a
thesis, by Julius Winden, has been of great
advantage, as will be indicated, in presenting
the influence of the Erie Canal
upon the population along its course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The author is under a debt of gratitude

<h3>THE MOHAWK AND ITS IMPROVEMENT</h3>


<p>The &ldquo;great western&rdquo; route through
New York State to the Lakes has
come under consideration in our
study of highways in three places: as an
Indian trail, as a portage path, and as a
pioneer road. The old Iroquois Trail, as
we have called it, ran up the Mohawk,
which it crossed at Nun-da-da-sis, &ldquo;around
the hill,&rdquo; (Utica); thence it made for the
Genesee River and the Niagara frontier;
an important tributary pathway led down
the Genesee to Swa-geh (Oswego) on Lake
Ontario. This was the landward route
from the Hudson to the Great Lakes. As
a thoroughfare in its entirety, it meant
much to the Indians, but very little to the
white men before the nineteenth century.
Though the lower Mohawk Valley was
sparsely settled early in the eighteenth
century, white men did not build their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
cabins along the Iroquois Trail to the
westward until nearly a century later,
when the old Genesee Road was opened.
Until then the country through which the
Iroquois Trail ran had been a <i>terra incognita</i>
where only Indian runners knew the way
through the Long House of the Iroquois.
Yet it was a pleasant country for all the
forest shades; from Nun-da-da-sis the trail
ran on, leaving the Mohawk River and
Ole-hisk, &ldquo;the place of nettles&rdquo;&mdash;the famed
battlefield of Oriskany&mdash;to the north,
passing Ka-ne-go-dick (Wood Creek) and
Ga-no-a-lo-hole (Lake Oneida), the &ldquo;Lake
of the Head on a Pole.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> To the southward,
the path bore away toward Na-ta-dunk
(Syracuse), the place of the &ldquo;broken
pine-tree,&rdquo; and Ga-do-quat (Fort Brewerton).
There were the silver lakes strung
like white gems on wreaths of heaviest
green. The low lands of the Genesee
country, soon to see the great advances
heralded by the famous purchases of land
speculators, intervened; and straight be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>yond,
far away across the pine-tree tops,
gleamed the Great Lakes and the plunging
river between them; the deep growl of
Niagara seemed to warn voyageurs away
to the forest trails on either side. Those
falls were the only interruption in a water
highway which in many aspects is, today,
the most stupendous in the world.</p>

<p>Had this winding trail been the only
means of communication between the
rapidly filling Hudson River valley and the
chain of lakes to the northwest, it is very
probable that a Braddock or a Forbes would
have built a military road even through
that bloody Long House; but the Mohawk
River, and the Oswego, offered a waterway
which, though difficult and uncertain, was
the white man&rsquo;s route from the Hudson to
the Lakes&mdash;the western war route of
which the portage at Rome was the key.
A clear picture of the old Mohawk
would be a precious possession. The
records, however, are so few and so general
in character that one would be at a loss
to supply an artist with his material. It is
only in the staid reports of old navigation
companies that we get any definite de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>scription
of our old-time rivers. We know
of the main obstructions to continuous
navigation in the Mohawk; first there
was the Ga-ha-oose Falls, or Cohoes Falls
as we know them today. These were impassable
for any craft, and made Schenectady
the metropolis of the lower Mohawk
Valley because it was the Mohawk terminus
of the difficult portage to Albany through
the pine barrens. Thus the old-time river
traffic began at Schenectady. Proceeding
northward by Te-hon-de-lo-ga, the famous
lower castle of the Mohawks, and Ga-no-jo-hi-e,
the middle castle, the traveler passed
the present Fonda, which was Ga-na-wa-da,
&ldquo;over the rapids,&rdquo; and came to the rocky
confines of Ta-la-que-ga, the &ldquo;place of
small bushes&rdquo;&mdash;the present Little Falls.
Here the roaring rapids interrupted all
navigation, empty boats not even being
able to pass over them. The early portage
of one mile here in sleds over the swampy
ground has been described as it was in
1756, when enterprising Teutons residing
here transferred all boats in sleds over
marshy ground which would &ldquo;admit of no
wheel carriage.&rdquo; In all of the military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
operations in the Mohawk Valley in the
French and Indian and Revolutionary wars
this portage played a part. As early as
1768, Governor Sir Henry Moore suggested
the improvement of the Mohawk at the
Falls of Canajoharie. A route for a canal
around Niagara Falls was surveyed in 1784.
Travelers to Niagara with heavy baggage
invariably went by way of the Mohawk
batteaus. We have seen that in 1793 two
of the commissioners to the western Indians,
traveling light, went overland by
horse to the Genesee, while General Lincoln
went with the heavy baggage by way
of the Mohawk.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> From Schenectady to
the Oneida Portage at Rome, Little Falls
offered the only insurmountable obstruction;
later on, about 1790, we find that the
Germans&rsquo; sleds were out of use and that
boats were transferred on wheeled vehicles
appropriately fashioned to carry them
without damage to their hulls. No great
boats could be transferred by such means;
this fact had a tendency to limit the carrying
capacity of Mohawk batteaus to about
one and a half tons. These boats were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
operated by three men, and a journey from
Rome to Schenectady and return&mdash;one
hundred and twelve miles&mdash;required, at
the least estimate, nine days. Such was
the high rate of freight that, if no return
freight was secured, the cost of sending a
ton to Schenectady equaled one man&rsquo;s
wages for eighteen days, about fourteen
dollars.</p>

<p>The improvement of the Mohawk before
1792 was, without doubt, of no real consequence.
Ascending boatmen and forwarding
companies here and there of necessity
made the river passable, otherwise there
could have been no traffic at all. As one
of our maps shows, as early as 1730 a neck
of land, in one instance, was cut through.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The batteaus which carried provisions and
ammunition northward to Fort Stanwix
or Fort Schuyler probably often broke a
new way through the dams of forest driftwood
which the flood tides left; and at
high tide there was, we know, good downward
navigation. Elkanah Watson must
be remembered as one of the pioneers in
the improvement of the central New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
waterway. In 1788 he made a western
journey by way of the Mohawk, and his
journal is full of observations which show
him to have been a far-sighted man with
correct ideas of the logical advance of commerce
and the revolutions it would make.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Returning from his journey October, 1791,
he prepared all the facts in favor of improving
New York&rsquo;s western waterway, in
the form of a pamphlet which he presented
to General Schuyler, then a member of the
state senate. He also contributed an
anonymous article to one of the papers in
January, 1792, urging publicly the improvement
of the Mohawk and Oswego Rivers.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Public interest being awakened, in one
way or another, as to the value of the
river route westward, and the route up the
Hudson and across to Lake George and
Lake Champlain, a bill was presented to
the New York legislature authorizing the
formation of two companies to undertake
the work of improving these strategic pas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>sageways
between the country east of the
state and the country west. Accordingly,
on the thirtieth day of March, 1792, the
following act was passed by the legislature:
<i>An Act for establishing and opening Lock
Navigation within this State</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The legal
name of the company which was to operate
on the Mohawk was the &ldquo;president, directors,
and company of the western inland
lock navigation in the state of New-York.&rdquo;
The word &ldquo;northern&rdquo; was inserted
in the legal name of the Hudson-Lake
Champlain company, which was
otherwise the same. The two companies
were chartered by one and the same act, on
exactly the same basis; we will consider,
however, only the one under discussion.</p>

<p>The Western Inland Lock Navigation
Company, to operate between the Hudson,
and Lake Seneca and Lake Ontario, was to
be capitalized at $25,000; one thousand
shares of twenty-five dollars each, no
stockholder being allowed more than
ten shares. The subscription books were
ordered to be opened at New York and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Albany on the first Tuesday of May, 1792,
and kept open until the last Tuesday. If
five hundred shares were taken the organization
became effective. Thirteen directors
were to control its affairs and they
were to be elected annually. Article VII
authorized &ldquo;... each of the said corporations
... [to] enter into, and
upon all and singular the land and lands
covered with water, where they shall deem
it proper to carry the canals and navigation
hereinbefore particularly assigned to
each....&rdquo; The stipulations usually
made in such cases, as to the company&rsquo;s
right to enter land by paying damages,
were nominated. The controlling officers
were empowered to name the per cent of
stock the stockholders were to be required
to pay. They were also to decide upon
the rates of toll to be charged to boats for
the enjoyment of benefits of navigation;
the one restriction was that the charge for
one ton of freight from Ontario or Seneca
lakes to the Hudson should not exceed
twenty-five dollars, and other tolls were to
be pro rata. The directors were to be allowed
to increase the capital stock at discretion, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
were ordered to make semiannual reports
to the public. After ten years an abstract
record was to be published for the inspection
of the legislature, and if the profits
were found to exceed fifteen per cent, the
excess above this amount they were to
turn over to the state treasurer. The act
of incorporation also stipulated that the
company&rsquo;s charter became void if work
was not undertaken in five years; if the
work was not completed in fifteen years,
all rights, so far as the residue was concerned,
were to be forfeited. The state of
New York promised to give, as a free gift,
to both the Western and the Northern companies,
$12,500 as soon as both had invested
$25,000 in the work on which they
were starting.</p>

<p>On December 22, 1792, the act was
amended as the lessons of the season
seemed to indicate that there was necessity.
The principal amendments were
that the locks built on the company&rsquo;s
works should have a breadth of not less
than ten feet at the base and should have
a length of not less than seventy feet
between gates. The company was to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
allowed, in the future, to take up land
without first having paid for it&mdash;settlement
to be made afterward in proper legal
form. The land under all locks was
vested in the company owning the locks.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It would seem from Elkanah Watson&rsquo;s
account that, when these subscription
books were opened for signatures of prospective
stockholders, there were absolutely
no subscribers forthcoming. &ldquo;They had
been opened three days by the committee,&rdquo;
he wrote from New York where he happened
to be in April (?), &ldquo;at the old coffee-house,
and not a share was subscribed. I
considered the cause hopeless&mdash;called on
my friend (I think it was) James Watson,
Esq., and induced him, with much pursuasion,
to subscribe twenty [?] shares; from
that moment the subscriptions went on
briskly. On my arrival in Albany, the
commissioners had kept the books open
several days, at Lewis&rsquo;s old tavern, in
State street, and no mortal had yet signed
to exceed <i>two shares</i>. I immediately subscribed
seven in each company....&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Watson also wrote to Schuyler of the low
state of affairs; the latter ordered him to
subscribe to ten shares in Schuyler&rsquo;s name.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>A committee appointed by the directors
of the Western Company, August 14, 1792,
consisting of Philip Schuyler, Goldsbrow
Bangar, and Elkanah Watson, to examine
the Mohawk from Fort Schuyler (Rome) to
Schenectady, reported in the following
September. Accompanied by the surveyor
Moses De Witt, and Mr. Lightall, a carpenter,
and a Mr. Nesbit, the committee
left Schenectady August 21 in a batteau,
and reached Fort Schuyler on the twenty-ninth.
Their itinerary gives us a picture
of the old river, and preserves valuable
facts for local historians.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The first day&rsquo;s
journey was six and one-half miles to John
Mabey&rsquo;s, half a mile above Jacobus Swart&rsquo;s.
Six rapids were passed, over which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
water ran, on the average, a foot and a
half deep&mdash;the river then having the least
water running &ldquo;within the memory of the
eldest person.&rdquo; The night of the twenty-second
was spent at John Fonda&rsquo;s, seventeen
and three-fourths miles up the river;
in this distance were five sharp rapids and
many small rapids with shallow water, as
at Sir William Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;first settlement,&rdquo;
eight and one-half miles above
Mabey&rsquo;s. The night of the twenty-third
was spent at Mr. Nellis&rsquo;s, nineteen and
three-fourths miles on; one mile above
Fonda&rsquo;s was &ldquo;Caughnawaga rift, deep,
incommoded with large rocks;&rdquo; nine miles
onward, lay Kettar&rsquo;s rapid, and two and a
half miles on was Colonel John Fry&rsquo;s. A
journey of four miles the next day brought
the examiners to Fort Hendrick, four and
a half miles below Little Falls. &ldquo;From
the landing at the foot [of Little Falls], to
the landing at the head of the Falls, is
about three-quarters of a mile, the height
thirty-nine feet two inches, the ground
stony, rocky and rough.&rdquo; It will be seen
that this was not the old-time portage over
which boats were drawn on sleds. Two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
days were spent examining this strategic
fall. Proceeding on the twenty-seventh,
Fort Schuyler, about fifty miles distant,
was reached on the twenty-ninth. The
navigation throughout this distance was
good with but two rapids, Orendorff&rsquo;s and
Wolf&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The recommendations of the committee
affirm that the work at Little Falls will be
the most important and expensive single
work, and would consist of a canal by
which river craft can overcome the fall of
nearly forty feet; in addition to the canal
&ldquo;a strong work ... to prevent the
Canal and Locks from being overflowed,
and damaged in high freshes; at this point
two guard gates at the distance of seventy
feet from each other must be placed; the
surface of the ground here is eight feet
eight inches above the level of the water
in the river above the falls, and, as three
feet ought to be given for the depth of the
water in the Canal, the depth to be dug at
this point will be nearly twelve feet....
Many large stones and rocks, and probably
much solid rock will be found in all the
distance ... which is 1666 feet; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
quantity of earth, stone, and rock to be
removed in this space, if the Canal has ten
feet base, will be about 242,200 cubic feet.
[For] 422 feet the Canal must be confined
by a double dyke, or embankment, about
four feet high; [for] 123 feet the whole
depth to be dug is about 4&frac12; feet and contains
5,085 cubic feet; at various places to
the water at the bottom of the falls about
100,000 cubic feet of earth must be removed,
and about 1,200 feet of a dyke to
be made. An estimate of the expense of
this work with five Locks ... amounts
to &pound;10,500.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The improvement of the river from
Schenectady to the mouth of the Schoharie
would call for an expenditure of &pound;20,000 in
dykes, dams, and small canals.</p>

<p>At Rome a canal 5,352 feet long was proposed
as a substitute for the ancient portage
path; &ldquo;apparently the mean depth of
the earth to be removed for forming the
Canal would be about twelve feet at the
greatest depth, hence about 642,240 cubic
feet of earth must be removed. The
ground though soft is so much interwoven
with the roots of trees, and the work will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
also be so much retarded by the influx of
water into the Canal whilst digging, that
it is supposed that one man could not
remove above fifty cubic feet per day,
hence 12,845 days for one man would be
required; which at 4s. per day amounts
to &pound;2,569. In very dry times, such as the
present, the water in the Mohawk is so
little that none can be spared to increase
the quantity in Wood Creek. A bulkhead
must therefore be placed ... precisely
of the height with the level of the water in
the Mohawk, a boat then in this low state
of the river coming up Wood Creek ...
must unlade, and be drawn across the bulkhead
into the Canal; there reloaded and
proceed through the Canal into the Mohawk
River; but when the Mohawk River rises
so much as that a quantity of water equal
to carry an empty boat is added to the
water in the river, the water on the bulkhead
will rise to nearly that height, and
the empty boat will pass. If the rise be
equal to the water drawn by a loaded boat,
the boat and its cargo will pass the bulkhead
into the Canal. It is evident by this
arrangement the navigation of Wood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Creek will be much mended whenever the
water in the Mohawk is higher than at
present. The whole expence at this place
will probably not exceed &pound;3,000.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of the general observations of this
committee are important in the history of
water transportation across New York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having premised thus much your Committee
beg leave to observe, That since
(except in such an extraordinary dry season
as the present) the river from Schenectady
to Scohara Creek is capable of considerable
navigation&mdash;is still better from thence to
the Falls, and will be good to Fort Schuyler,
especially if the trees and timber are
removed, That therefore, except the removal
of the trees and timber West of, and
blowing a few rocks on, some of the rapids,
East of the Falls, nothing further should
be speedily attempted in the parts mentioned;
but that the primary exertions
should be directed to the Canal and Locks
at the Falls; that when this is completed,
the water in the river above, will probably
be sufficiently low to clear away the timber
which incommodes it, and to do the like
by Wood-Creek down to the Oneida Lake,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and to remove the most dangerous rocks
below the Falls. This accomplished, the
next in degree of eligibility, appears to
your Committee, to extend the navigation
from Schenectady to the navigable waters
of the Hudson&mdash;because when with the
improvements above suggested, the river
shall be rendered navigable in the greater
part of its extent from Fort Schuyler to
Schenectady, in all seasons not so dry as
the present, for boats of considerable
burthen; yet the portage from Schenectady
to Albany, is not only a very heavy
charge on the produce of the upper country,
but attended with serious inconveniences
to those who enter largely into the
interior commerce. To prepare for the
accomplishment of this apparently very
necessary part of the navigation, your committee
recommend, That accurate surveys
should be made, as early in the ensuing
spring as circumstances will permit, to
enable the board to determine the direction
in which Canals are to run, to take the
necessary preliminary measures for providing
the materials; that, if the works at
the Falls, &amp;c., should be completed before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the whole of the next operating season is
expired, the residue may be appropriated
to this important part of the navigation,
and completed in the succeeding year;&mdash;Soon
after this shall be accomplished, the
company will be enabled to judge with
precision, what farther is in their power,
and if what they have done, should prove
beneficial to the community at large, and
the resources of the company be then found
not competent to such a perfect completion
of the whole internal navigation, as is contemplated
by the act of incorporation, there
can be little doubt but that an enlightened
Legislature will extend its aid, to objects
promising such extensive benefits to every
class of citizens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It now remains for your Committee to
venture an opinion on the mode of conducting
the contemplated improvements.
The observations already made will evince
the necessity of strict economy in every
operation. It will certainly occur to the
Directors, that in a work so extensive, as
that committed to them, much unnecessary
expence, and much waste of time must be
incurred, unless the executive part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
business be properly conferred; and your
committee, to avoid this evil as much as
possible, recommend that the executive of
the business should be committed to a
single directing head, to a man of known
and acknowledged abilities, of a mind so
comprehensive, as to combine and form all
the arrangements, with a minute detail of
each part....</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Person who has had practical experience
in making canals and locks, would be
a desirable and valuable acquisition, but
such a person may not be attainable in this
country; if so, it has occurred to your
committee, that probably the defect might
be supplied, if the person to whom the
general direction shall be committed was
to select two or three of our most ingenious
and best informed carpenters, and
repair with them to view the works in
Pennsylvania and Virginia, with a critical
and close attention. Canals and locks are
already formed there, and little doubt can
be entertained but that every information
which gentlemen are capable of communicating
will be afforded with alacrity; and
your committee have too good an opinion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of their countrymen to apprehend, that if
your superintendant is a man of genius,
and the mechanics who accompany him
men of approved reputation in their professions,
they would not after such an
inspection be able to fulfil the wishes of
their employers with satisfaction and credit
to both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Work on the Mohawk River improvements<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
was begun in April, 1793, by a force
of three hundred men; the digging of the
canal around the Little Falls was the most
important item in the difficult undertaking.
Soon the company&rsquo;s funds gave out and
work ceased. It was begun again feebly
in January, 1794, in hopes that the next
legislature would assist by grants, loans, or
money, or by subscribing to stock in the
company. In this the company was not
disappointed, for the state subscribed to
two hundred shares of stock in each of the
improvement schemes. In May, 1795, work
was again resumed, and in November of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
that year boats could go about Little Falls
in the canal. It was opened November
seventeenth and on that day nine boats
passed through gratis. In the next thirty
days &ldquo;eight large boats, and one hundred
and two small boats, passed the little falls
on the Mohawk, and paid toll in the aggregate
of &pound;80.10.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>This famous little canal, for in its day it
was a very significant piece of work, was
4,752 feet long; it contained five locks,
each having a lift of about nine feet; the
total rise of boats ascending was forty-four
feet and seven inches. The locks were
located at the lower end of the canal; &ldquo;the
pits, in which they are placed, have been
excavated out of solid rock, of the hardest
kind. The area of the chambers was
74&times;12 feet, admitting boats drawing 3&frac12;
feet; the depth of water in the canal
above the locks was three feet and would
float boats carrying 32 tons; the time of
the passage was three quarters of an hour.
Nearly one-half of the canal (2550 feet)
was cut through solid rock and its total
original cost was about $50,000.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time, 1793, work was begun
at other points, principally on a canal from
the Mohawk to the Hudson (to avoid
Cohoes Falls), but the work soon ceased
because of lack of funds. In that summer
the preliminary work on the water route
down Wood Creek and the Onondaga to
Lake Ontario was done. The little, winding
creek was found to be almost incorrigible.
It was so crooked that thirteen cuts
were made across the points of land contained
within its curving banks. The
banks were lined with aged trees whose
predecessors had fallen into the narrow
waterway which they choked with their
many huge, straggling branches. It was
no less a task to remove the d&eacute;bris from
the waterway than it was to remove from
the banks the trees which would fall into
the water during the next windstorm.
Many have written gaily of the swift canoes
of the olden days, gliding peacefully on
the limpid surface of the old-time rivers;
a study of the condition of the old Mohawk,
Susquehanna, or Ohio would have corrected
suggestions which are inherently
misrepresentations. On such smaller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
streams as Little River or Wood Creek, the
havoc of the wind was even more noticeable.
The company now at work on Wood
Creek planned to clear the banks of timber
for four rods back on each bank and, by the
report of 1796, the contracts were actually
proposed to that effect. The company had
trouble with settlers along the rivers, for
felling trees which grew along the banks
into the water, thereby saving themselves
the labor of burning them or hauling them
away. The company expected to cut a
canal from the Mohawk to Wood Creek
near Rome, New York, to take the place
of the famous portage path. In the report
of 1796 it was proposed even to mortgage
the works at Little Falls in order to secure
funds for this portage canal.</p>

<p>The plan of the complete communication
was outlined by the company&rsquo;s engineer,
Mr. Weston, December 23, 1795, and was
embodied in the report of 1796. It called
for a canal from the Hudson, above Lansing&rsquo;s
Mill, to the Mohawk above Cohoes
Falls; these falls, seventy feet in height,
had made necessary the portage path
through the pine barrens from Schenectady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to Albany. The surveyor spoke hopefully
of the rapids between Schenectady and
Utica (Fort Schuyler) since rapids always
indicated pools above and below. The
rapids were to be overcome by small, low
dams with oblique walls &ldquo;to collect a
greater quantity of water in the channel
and pond above.&rdquo; In the forty odd miles
down Wood Creek and Lake Oneida to Fort
Brewerton, the &ldquo;chief impediment is occasioned
by an old Indian ell wear [weir]&mdash;a
wing wall to confine the channel into a
narrow compass.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> At Oswego Falls
(Rochester) a canal was proposed on the
south side of the river, sixty-two chains in
length, and with a fall of eighteen feet.
Thence to Lake Ontario, twelve miles, the
rapidity of the river necessitated a series
of dams and locks. &ldquo;Arrived at lake
Ontario, it is almost superfluous to remark
(what is so obvious to every person the
least acquainted with the geography of the
state) on the immense expanse of internal
navigation, that opens upon our view&mdash;the
extent of these lakes (with one obstruction
only, that doubtless will be surmounted in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
a few years) presents to the mind&mdash;a scene
unequalled in any other part of the globe;
offering to the enterprising and adventurous,
sources of trade, rapidly advancing to
an incalculable amount, ensuring a certain
recompence to the individuals, who promote,
and the state, that patronizes their
important undertakings.&rdquo; Thus Mr. Weston
concluded his report.</p>

<p>Yet the projectors of this work were
men ahead of their days; in a great measure
public sympathy was not in favor of
the undertaking, especially along the line
of operation. Here the strongest objections
were raised, some of them of a curious
nature. One petition to the legislature
read that the operations on the Hudson
&ldquo;will Cause the Fish to wit Shad, Herrin
&amp;c. Totally to Abandon the North River,
a circumstance which would be felt not
only by Your Petitioners but by thousands
Residing between Fort Edward and as far
Southward as the River Extends.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It was found to be all the company could
do to keep things going on the eastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
division of their works; much less carry
on the work in the west. In ten years the
company spent $367,743 and, in the end,
sank about $100,000 more. The greatest
expense was in remedying faults and failures.
&ldquo;... hence the expenditures
baffled all calculation,&rdquo; frankly writes Watson;
&ldquo;&mdash;besides, we were all novices in
this department.... Indeed we
were so extremely deficient in a knowledge
of the science of constructing locks and
canals, that we found it expedient to send
a committee of respectable mechanics, to
examine the imperfect works then constructing
on the Potowmac,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> for the purpose
of gaining information&mdash;we had no
other resource but from books.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Wooden
locks were built at Little Falls, German
Flats, and Rome at large expense, and
these rotted in six years. It was wooden
locks like these that the New Yorkers had
found the Virginians building on the
Potomac. The locks at German Flats and
at Rome were rebuilt with brick, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
mortar was poor and they fell to pieces.
Finally, at all points, the locks were built
of stone. This experimenting was extremely
expensive work and explains why,
for a long time, no dividends could be paid.
Up to December, 1804, the company had
received $232,000, which was paid on 2,630
shares of capital stock. It had received
$25,494 on forfeited shares. The tolls at
Little Falls since 1796, when the works
there were completed, amounted to $58,346;
at Rome, $15,037 had been taken in as
tolls. The sum of $12,500 had been received
as a gift from the state. Of the total
stock the state held $92,000, and the private
stockholders, $140,000. In 1798 a dividend
of 3 per cent had been declared; in
1813, a dividend of 3&frac12;; in 1814, a dividend
of 3; 4&frac12; per cent dividend was paid in
1815, 8 per cent in 1816, 3 per cent in 1817,
and 5&frac12; per cent in 1818. All receipts
from 1798 to 1813 had been absorbed in
improvements and repairs.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<h3>EARLY PROMOTERS AND THEIR DREAMS</h3>


<p>The honor of originating the plan of a
canal from the Great Lakes to the
Hudson will forever lie with the
brilliant, visionary Gouverneur Morris.
The idea must have suggested itself to other
minds even if it occurred to Morris originally;
this cannot be disproved; but
Morris&rsquo;s shoulders were broad enough for
an honor too great for many, and his persistent
labors in behalf of the project are
altogether consistent with this verdict of a
century. In 1777 Morris was known to
have hinted of what we know as the Erie
Canal. In that year he was sent to General
Schuyler&rsquo;s army at Fort Edward, then
slowly retiring before Burgoyne&rsquo;s advancing
regiments. Morgan Lewis, then quartermaster,
later governor of New York,
leaves this testimony, in a letter dated
May 26, 1828: &ldquo;One evening in particular,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
while describing in the most animated and
glowing terms the rapid march of the useful
arts through our country, when once
freed from a foreign yoke; the spirit with
which agriculture and commerce both external
and internal would advance; the
facilities which would be afforded them by
the numerous water courses, intersecting
the country, and the ease by which they
might be made to communicate; he announced,
in language highly poetic, and to
which I cannot do justice, that at no very
distant day the waters of the great western
inland seas would, by the aid of man,
break through their barriers and mingle
with those of the Hudson. I recollect asking
him how they were to break through
these barriers. To which he replied, that
numerous streams passed them through
natural channels, and that artificial ones
might be conducted by the same routes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>In his diary for October, 1795, Morris
describes his feeling on viewing the Caledonian
Canal in Scotland; &ldquo;when I see
this,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;my mind opens to a view<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of wealth for the interior of America,
which hitherto I had rather conjectured
than seen.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In a letter to Mr. Parish in
January, 1801, he observes, after seeing a
number of ships riding at anchor in Lake
Erie, &ldquo;Hundreds of large ships will, at no
distant period, bound on the billows of
these inland seas. At this point begins a
navigation of more than a thousand miles
[to the extremity of Lake Superior]. Shall
I lead your astonishment up to the verge
of incredulity? I will. Know then that
one-tenth of the expense, borne by Britain
in the last campaign, would enable ships
to sail from London through Hudson&rsquo;s
River <i>into Lake Erie</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The merit of first starting the idea of
a direct communication by water, between
lake Erie and Hudson&rsquo;s river,&rdquo; wrote
Simeon De Witt to William Darby, February
25, 1822, &ldquo;unquestionably belongs to
Mr. Gouverneur Morris. The first suggestion
I had of it was from him. In 1803, I
accidentally met with him at Schenectady.
We put up for the night at the same inn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and passed the evening together. Among
the numerous topics of conversation, to
which his prolific mind, and excursive
imagination, gave birth, was that of improving
the means of intercourse with the
interior of our state. He then mentioned
the project of <i>tapping Lake Erie</i>, as he expressed
it himself, and leading its waters,
in an artificial river, directly across the
country to Hudson&rsquo;s river. To this I very
naturally opposed the intervening hills and
valleys as insuperable obstacles. His answer
was in substance, <i>labor improbus omnia
vincit</i>, and that the object would justify
the labour and expense, whatever that might
be. Considering this a romantic thing,
and characteristic of the man, I related it
on several occasions.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> J. Geddes wrote
William Darby, February 22, 1822, as follows:
&ldquo;In the year of 1804, I learnt for
the <i>first time</i>, from the surveyor-general
[Simeon De Witt] that Mr Gouverneur Morris,
in a conversation between them in the
preceding autumn, mentioned the scheme
of a canal from lake Erie across the coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>try
to the Hudson river. The idea of saving
so much lockage by not descending to
lake Ontario made a very lively impression
on my mind.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>With canal building going on in other
portions of the country, it was inevitable
that the suggestion made by Morris could
not down. The opportunity offered here
in central New York was so favorable, that
a people with only half the ambition and
ability of New Yorkers would have profited
sooner or later by it. Having studied the
tremendous tasks undertaken by the Marylanders
and Pennsylvanians, it can be understood
why the Erie Canal was under
consideration at a comparatively early date;
the Mohawk offered a gateway through the
northern foothills of the Alleghenies, and
beyond lay lakes and rivers in the direct
route to Lake Erie. There could be no
question of water supply at the summit
level; the waterways to be crossed, however,
might cause the engineers no little
trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been able to trace,&rdquo; Mr.
Watson leaves record, &ldquo;any measure, pub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>lic
or private, tending towards this great
enterprize, till the 27th October, 1807,
when an anonymous publication, under the
signature of Hercules, appeared in the
Genesee Messenger of Canandaigua, which
is attributed to Jesse Hawley, Esq. now
[1820] collector of the port of Rochester.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
It is affirmed that these communications
were not inspired by the prophetic words
of Morris;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> they were fourteen in number,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and were contributed weekly from October,
1807, to March, 1808. Hawley had thought
out his problem with great seriousness and
detail, and had splendidly planned a canal
from Buffalo to Utica, where improved
navigation on the Mohawk was to be depended
upon. The cost he estimated at
five millions. It is not at all unlikely that
Hawley&rsquo;s attention was the more quickly
attracted to this subject because of the
celebrated message of President Jefferson
to Congress in this fall of 1807, just when
Hercules was writing his articles.</p>

<p>It was probably the general discussion
of this great theme, more than the result
of any one influence, which led to the
crystallization of the movement, when on
February 4, 1808, Joshua Forman, a member
of the New York legislature, from Onondaga
County, offered the following bill:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereas the President of the United
States by his message to Congress, delivered
at their meeting in October last, did
recommend that the surplus money in the
treasury, over and above such sums as
could be applied to the extinguishment of
the national debt, be appropriated to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
great national objects of opening canals
and making turnpike roads. And whereas
the state of New York, holding the first
commercial rank in the United States, possesses
within herself the best route of
communication between the Atlantic and
western waters, by means of a canal,
between the tide waters of the Hudson
river and Lake Erie,&mdash;through which the
wealth and trade of that large portion of
the United States, bordering on the upper
lakes, would for ever flow to our great
commercial emporium. And whereas the
legislatures of several of our sister states,
have made great exertions to secure to
their own states the trade of that wide
extended country, west of the Alleganies,
under natural advantages vastly inferior
to those of this state. And whereas it is
highly important that these advantages
should as speedily as possible be improved,
both to preserve and increase the commerce
and national importance of this
state:&mdash;Resolved, (if the honourable the
senate concur herein) that a joint committee
be appointed to take into consideration
the propriety of exploring, and causing an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
accurate survey to be made of the most
eligible and direct route for a canal to open
a communication between the tide waters of
the Hudson river and Lake Erie; to the
end that congress may be enabled to appropriate
such sums as may be necessary to
the accomplishment of that great national
object.&rdquo; In the general appropriation bill
now passed the sum of $600 was allotted to
a survey of this proposed canal and the
work was done by James Geddes, whose
report, at a later day, became important.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Forman&rsquo;s motion passed, but
amounted to nothing. In 1810 Thomas
Eddy, the treasurer of the old Western
Inland Lock Navigation Company, called
on General Platt, a member of the New
York senate, and the two conversed seriously
about the great plan which was
slowly coming more and more to the front.
Platt affirmed that he would offer a resolution
in the legislature looking toward increasing
public interest in the great dream
of the farthest-seeing men of New York.
Perhaps the two drafted this resolution; at
least, the very next day Platt handed De<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Witt Clinton a draft of a resolution. Clinton
liked it. Its author thereupon offered
it in the senate and Clinton supported it
and it passed, March 13, 1810. It began:
&ldquo;Whereas, the agricultural and commercial
interests of the state, require that the
inland navigation from the Hudson river
to lake Ontario and lake Erie, be improved
and completed on a scale commensurate to
the great advantages derived from the accomplishment
of that important object: And
whereas, it is doubtful whether the resources
of the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company
are adequate to such improvements:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Therefore resolved</i>, that if the honourable
the assembly consent herein, that Gouverneur
Morris, Stephen Van Rensselaer, De
Witt Clinton, Simeon De Witt, William
North, Thomas Eddy and Peter B. Porter,
be and they are hereby appointed commissioners
for exploring the whole route,
examining the present condition of the
said navigation, and considering what
further improvements ought to be made
therein; and that they be authorized to
direct and procure such surveys as to them
shall appear necessary and proper in rela<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>tion
to these objects; and that they report
thereon to the legislature, at their next
session, presenting a full view of the subjects
referred to them, with their estimates
and opinion thereon.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> On April 5 following
$3,000 was appropriated for the
expenses of the surveys called for in the
above resolution.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly the commissioners named
explored the country between the Hudson
and Lake Erie through which the prospective
waterway would run, in the summer
of 1810 with Jesse Hawley&rsquo;s contributions
of 1807-08 in their hands. At the next
meeting of the legislature they presented
an elaborate report. It would seem that
the committee had passed over the route
of the Western Inland Lock Navigation
Company from Schenectady to Lake Ontario;
James Geddes, the experienced
engineer who had given some little study
to the region under survey, made a map
and a few rough estimates. The report<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
opens with the declaration that the idea of
making small rivers navigable had long
ago been exploded in Europe; this was a
polite way of saying that the days of the
Lock Navigation Company were fairly
numbered. The report affirms that a canal
parallel with the rivers improved by the
Navigation Company (Mohawk, Wood
Creek, and Oswego) is practicable as far
as Oswego Falls (Rochester). The twelve
remaining miles to Lake Ontario might
well be covered by a railway.</p>

<p>However, the committee had another
plan, that of building the canal straight
west from the Oswego to Lake Erie,
avoiding Lake Ontario&rsquo;s winds and waves
entirely. Certain interesting commercial
questions were here involved. Even with
the advantages offered by the Western
Inland Lock Navigation Company, New
York and Albany could not hold their own
in competition with Montreal. Freight rates
down the St. Lawrence were marvelously
cheap; fifty cents a hundredweight, only,
was charged by descending boatmen from
Kingston to Montreal&mdash;one-half the early
rate from Buffalo to New York on the Erie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Canal when it was at last built. The rate
of freight up the St. Lawrence was only
one dollar per hundredweight. If any
point east of Niagara Falls was made the
terminus of New York&rsquo;s canal, it was
feared that Montreal would profit by it more,
perhaps, than the cities it was intended to
build up and benefit.</p>

<p>Mr. Geddes favored the direct route to
Lake Erie by way of the &ldquo;Tanawanta&rdquo;
River. He advanced the following rough
estimate of distances in the direct route:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>The actual descent would be 525 feet.
Mr. Geddes&rsquo;s plan included aqueducts
across the Genesee River twenty-six feet
high and one hundred and fifty yards long,
across the mouth of Seneca Lake eighty-three
feet high, and across the mouth of
Cayuga one hundred and thirty feet high.
As a detailed survey had not been made,
it was impossible to estimate accurately
the expense.</p>

<p>Agitation of the great question was the
only tangible result of this investigation.
In 1811 Robert Livingston and Robert
Fulton were added to the committee, and a
report was made to the legislature, March,
1812. This report showed that the friends
of the great waterway had resolved to
exhaust all resources before relinquishing
the work. They applied to Congress
through Morris and De Witt Clinton for
&ldquo;Co-operation and aid in making a canal
navigation between the great lakes and
Hudson&rsquo;s river, which, in the opinion of
the Legislature of New-York, will encourage
agriculture, promote commerce and
manufacture, ficilitate [<i>sic</i>] a free and
general intercourse between different parts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of the United States, tend to the aggrandizement
and prosperity of the country,
and consolidate and strengthen the Union.&rdquo;
The legislatures of the various states were
likewise asked to lend sympathy and aid&mdash;to
co-operate and aid New York in opening
the communication between the Great
Lakes and the Hudson. &ldquo;... The
general advantage to the whole nation,&rdquo; it
was urged, &ldquo;is of such preponderating
influence, as to render the present object
of principal, if not exclusive, concern to
the national legislature.&rdquo; The ways of
help suggested were pecuniary assistance
in the form of loans or gifts, and a friendly
voice in favor of the project in Congress.
A letter to President Madison expressed
the hope that in his annual message to
Congress he would in every consistent way
urge the plan of national assistance. Accordingly
in Madison&rsquo;s message, dated
December 23, 1812, he enclosed the act of
the New York legislature and said: &ldquo;The
particular undertaking contemplated by the
state of New-York ... will recall the
attention of Congress to the signal advantages
to be derived to the United States,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
from a general system of internal communication
and conveyance.... As some
of those advantages have an intimate connexion
with arrangements and exertions
for the general security, it is a period calling
for these that the merits of such a system
will be seen in the strongest lights.&rdquo;
Thomas Eddy wrote Simeon De Witt January
9, 1812 &ldquo;... accounts from
Washington this days post say that the
expectations of our committee respecting
aid from Congress are very flattering&mdash;the
project of a Canal from Erie to the Hudson
has many friends West of the Allegany&mdash;We
are full of the news that De Witt Clinton
will be president and Munro Vice
p&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;this is the united wish of all parties
in this City except Madisonians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great, comprehensive plan of national
aid to local improvements was proposed,
by means of giving grants of land in
Michigan to a large number of improvement
schemes in various states. Article
seven read: &ldquo;<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That
four million acres of land, part of the tracts
above mentioned, shall vest in and belong
to the said state of New-York, so soon as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
canal shall be opened from lake Erie to
Hudson&rsquo;s river, not less than sixty-three
feet wide on the top, forty-five feet wide at
the bottom, and five feet deep (and, if
practicable, along an inclined plane, descending
not more than six feet in a mile,)
to Hudson&rsquo;s river, or a bason within four
miles thereof; on condition, nevertheless,
that no tax, toll, or impost, shall be levied
or taken for the passage of boats not
exceeding sixty feet long, eighteen feet
wide or drawing more than three feet of
water on the same canal, other than such
as may be needful to pay the annual
expenses of superintending and keeping the
same in repair.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The war which now came on drove all
plans of internal improvement from men&rsquo;s
minds until the struggle for honor and
independence was won. The bill quoted
was never passed by Congress; a law
passed by the New York legislature in
1812, authorizing the canal commissioners
to borrow five million dollars on the
credit of the state, was repealed in 1814.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
These had been hard years for New York.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1816, Judge Platt,
while holding court in New York City,
was in consultation with Clinton and Eddy
concerning the canal project, which had
temporarily dropped from public attention.
Though the outlook was gloomy and discouraging,
these men determined to revive
public interest in the project if it was in
their power. An advertisement was placed
in the papers calling for a public meeting
at the City Hotel to consider asking the
New York legislature to attack the great
problem anew. A similar call was issued
at Albany for a meeting to be held February
7, 1816, at the Tontine Coffee House,
signed by ten friends of the movement.</p>

<p>William Bayard was chosen chairman of
the New York meeting, and the speakers
were Platt, Clinton, and Swartwout; Clinton,
Swartwout, and Thomas Eddy were
appointed a committee to prepare a
memorial for the legislature. This document
was drafted by De Witt Clinton and
marks a brilliant crisis in the long, wearing
struggle this brave coterie of men had
made for their favorite project. New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
was recovering from the devastation and
prostration caused by the war. The
awakening courage of a brave people was
stirred by the appeal of Clinton&rsquo;s; it was
so &ldquo;comprehensive a view of the immense
advantages that would be produced to the
state by the completion of the canal, that
copies sent throughout the state were
eagerly signed by thousands, and carried
full conviction to every mind. The project
immediately became popular, and it was
the means of rousing the legislature, and
produced several successive laws in prosecuting
this great work. A system of
finance was drawn up by De Witt Clinton
which with some trifling alterations, was
adopted by the legislature and is now
[1825] in successful operation.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

was born, and which throws much light on
the whole problem of early transportation,
is given in its entirety in the following

<p class="noidt">To the Legislature of the State of
New-York.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The memorial of the subscribers,
in favor of a canal navigation, between the
great western lakes and the tidewaters of
the Hudson, most respectfully represents:
That they approach the legislature with a
solicitude proportionate to the importance
of this great undertaking, and with a confidence
founded on the enlightened public
spirit of the constituted authorities. If, in
presenting the various considerations which
have induced them to make this appeal,
they should occupy more time than is usual
on common occasions, they must stand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
justified by the importance of the object.
Connected as it is with the essential interest
of our country, and calculated in its commencement
to reflect honor on the state,
and its completion, to exalt it to an elevation
of unparalleled prosperity; your memorialists
are fully persuaded, that centuries
may pass away before a subject is again
presented so worthy of all your attention,
and so deserving of all your patronage and
support.</p>

<p>The improvement of the means of intercourse
between different parts of the same
country, has always been considered the
first duty and the most noble employment
of government. If it be important that the
inhabitants of the same country should be
bound together by a community of interests,
and a reciprocation of benefits; that
agriculture should find a sale for its productions,
manufacturers a vent for their
fabrics; and commerce a market for its
commodities; it is your incumbent duty, to
open, facilitate, and improve internal navigation.
The pre-eminent advantages of
canals have been established by the unerring
test of experience. They unite cheap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ness,
celerity, certainty, and safety in the
transportation of commodities.</p>

<p>It is calculated that the expense of transporting
on a canal, amounts to one cent a
ton per mile, or one dollar a ton for one
hundred miles; while the usual cost by
land conveyance, is one dollar and sixty
cents per hundredweight, or thirty-two
dollars a ton for the same distance. The
celerity and certainty of this mode of transportation
are evident. A loaded boat can
be towed by one or two horses, at the rate
of thirty miles a day. Hence, the seller or
buyer can calculate with sufficient precision
on his sales or purchases, the period of
their arrival, the amount of their avails,
and the extent of their value. A vessel on
a canal is independent of winds, tides, and
currents, and is not exposed to the delays
attending conveyances by land: and with
regard to safety, there can be no competition.
The injuries to which commodities
are exposed when transported by land, and
the dangers to which they are liable when
conveyed by natural waters, are rarely
experienced on canals. In the latter way,
comparatively speaking, no waste is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>curred,
no risk is encountered, and no
insurance is required. Hence, it follows,
that canals operate upon the general interests
of society, in the same way that
machines for saving labor do in manufactures;
they enable the farmer, the mechanic,
and the merchant, to convey their
commodities to market, and to receive a
return, at least thirty times cheaper than
by roads. As to all the purposes of beneficial
communication, they diminish the
distance between places, and therefore
encourage the cultivation of the most extensive
and remote parts of the country.
They create new sources of internal trade,
and augment the old channels, for, the
cheaper the transportation, the more expanded
will be its operation, and the
greater the mass of the products of the
country for sale, the greater will be the
commercial exchange of returning merchandize,
and the greater the encouragement
to manufacturers, by the increased
economy and comfort of living, together
with the cheapness and abundance of raw
materials; and Canals are consequently
advantageous to towns and villages, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
destroying the monopoly of the adjacent
country, and advantageous to the whole
country; for though some rival commodities
may be introduced into the old markets,
yet many new markets will be opened by
increasing population, enlarging old and
erecting new towns, augmenting individual
and aggregate wealth, and extending foreign
commerce.</p>

<p>The prosperity of ancient Egypt, and
China, may in a great degree be attributed
to their inland navigation. With little
foreign commerce, the former of those
countries by these means attained and the
latter possesses, a population and opulence
in proportion to their extent, unequalled
in any other. And England and Holland,
the most commercial nations of modern
times, deprived of their canals, would lose
the most prolific sources of their prosperity
and greatness. Inland navigation is in fact
to the same community what exterior
navigation is to the great family of mankind.
As the ocean connects the nations
of the earth, by the ties of commerce and
the benefits of communication, so do lakes,
rivers, and canals operate upon the inhabi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>tants
of the same country: and it has been
well observed, that &ldquo;were we to make the
supposition of two states, the one having
all its cities, towns, and villages upon navigable
rivers and canals, and having an easy
communication with each other; the other
possessing the common conveyance of land
carriage, and supposing both states to be
equal as to soil, climate, and industry,
commodities and manufactures in the
former state, might be furnished thirty per
cent. cheaper than in the latter: or in other
words, the first state would be a third
richer, and more affluent than the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The general arguments in favor of inland
navigation, apply with peculiar force to
the United States, and most emphatically
to this state. A geographical view of the
country, will at once demonstrate the
unexampled prosperity that will arise from
our cultivating the advantages which nature
has dispensed with so liberal a hand. A
great chain of mountains passes through
the United States, and divides them into
eastern and western America. In various
places, rivers break through those mountains,
and are finally discharged into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
ocean. To the west, there is a collection
of inland lakes exceeding in its aggregate
extent, some of the most celebrated seas of
the old world. Atlantic America, on
account of the priority of its settlement, its
vicinity to the ocean, and its favorable
position for commerce, has many advantages.
The western country, however, has
a decided superiority in the fertility of its
soil, the benignity of its climate, and the
extent of its territory. To connect these
great sections by inland navigation, to
unite our Mediterranean seas with the
ocean, is evidently an object of the first
importance to the general prosperity. Nature
has effected this in some measure; the
St Lawrence emanates from the lakes, and
discharges itself into the ocean in a foreign
territory. Some of the streams which flow
into the Mississippi, originate near the
great lakes and pass around the chain of
mountains. Some of the waters of this state
which pass into Lake Ontario, approach the
Mohawk; but our Hudson has decided advantages.
It affords a tide navigation for
vessels of 80 tons to Albany and Troy, 160
miles above New-York, and this peculiarity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
distinguishes it from all the other bays and
rivers in the United States, viz:</p>

<p>The tide in no other ascends higher
than the Granite Ridge, or within thirty
miles of the Blue Ridge, or eastern chain
of mountains. In the Hudson, it breaks
through the Blue Ridge, and ascends above
the eastern termination of the Catskill, or
great western chain; and there are no interrupting
mountains to prevent a communication
between it and the great western
lakes.</p>

<p>The importance of the Hudson river to
the old settled parts of the state, may be
observed in the immense wealth which is
daily borne on its waters, in the flourishing
villages and cities on its banks, and in the
opulence and prosperity of all the country
connected with it, either remotely or immediately.
It may also be readily conceived,
if we only suppose that by some
awful physical calamity, some overwhelming
convulsion of nature, this great river
was exhausted of its waters: Where then
would be the abundance of our markets,
the prosperity of our farmers, the wealth
of our merchants? Our villages would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>come
deserted; our flourishing cities would
be converted into masses of mouldering
ruins, and this state would be precipitated
into poverty and insignificance. If a river
or natural canal, navigable about 170
miles, has been productive of such signal
benefits, what blessings might not be
expected, if it were extended 300 miles
through the most fertile country in the
universe, and united with the great seas of
the west! The contemplated canal would
be this extension, and viewed in reference
only to the productions and consumptions
of this state, would perhaps convey more
riches on its waters, than any other canal
in the world. Connected with the Hudson,
it might be considered as a navigable
stream that extends 450 miles through a
fertile country, embracing a great population,
and abounding with all the productions
of industry. If we were to suppose
all the rivers and canals in England and
Wales, combined into one, and discharged
into the ocean at a great city, after passing
through the heart of that country, then we
can form a distinct idea of the importance
of the projected canal; but it indeed com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>prehends
within its influence a greater
extent of territory, which will in time
embrace a greater population. If this work
be so important, when we confine our
views to this state alone, how unspeakably
beneficial must it appear, when we extend
our contemplations to the great lakes, and
the country affiliated with them! Waters
extending two thousand miles from the
beginning of the canal, and a country containing
more territory than all Great Britain
and Ireland, and at least as much as France.</p>

<p>While we do not pretend that all the
trade of our western world, will centre in
any given place, (nor indeed would it be
desirable if it were practicable, because we
sincerely wish the prosperity of all the
states,) yet we contend, that our natural
advantages are so transcendant, that it is
in our power to obtain the greater part,
and put successful competition at defiance.
As all the other communications are impeded
by mountains, the only formidable
rivals of New-York for this great prize, are
New-Orleans and Montreal, the former
relying on the Mississippi, and the latter
on the St Lawrence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>In considering this subject we will suppose
the commencement of the canal somewhere
near the out-let of Lake Erie. The
inducements for preferring one market to
another, involve a variety of considerations;
the principal are the cheapness and facility
of transportation, and the goodness of the
market. If a cultivator or manufacturer
can convey his commodities with the same
ease and expedition to New-York, and
obtain higher price for them than at Montreal
or New-Orleans, and at the same time
supply himself at a cheaper rate with such
articles as he may want in return, he will
undoubtedly prefer New-York. It ought
also to be distinctly understood, that a
difference in price may be equalized by a
difference in the expense of conveyance,
and that the vicinity of the market is at all
times a consideration of great importance.</p>

<p>From Buffalo, at or near the supposed
commencement of the canal, it is 450 miles
to the city of New-York, and from that
city to the ocean, 20 miles. From Buffalo
to Montreal 350 miles; from Montreal to
the Chops of the St Lawrence 450. From
Buffalo to New Orleans by the great Lakes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and the Illinois river, 2,250 miles; from
New-Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico 100.
Hence, the distance from Buffalo to the
ocean by the way of New-York is 470
miles; by Montreal 800; and by New-Orleans
2,350.</p>

<p>As the upper lakes have no important
outlet but into lake Erie, we are warranted
in saying, that all their trade must be
auxiliary to its trade, and that a favorable
communication by water from Buffalo, will
render New-York the great depot and
warehouse of the western world. In order,
however, to obviate all objections that may
be raised against the place of comparison,
let us take three other positions, <i>Chicago</i>
near the southwest end of lake Michigan,
and a creek of that name, which sometimes
communicates with the Illinois, the nearest
river from the lakes to the Mississippi;
<i>Detroit</i>, on the river of that name, between
lakes St Clair and Erie; and <i>Pittsburgh</i>, at
the confluence of the Alleghany and Monongahela
rivers, forming the head of the Ohio
and communicating with Le Beuf by water,
which is distant fifteen miles from lake
Erie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>The distance from Chicago to the ocean
by New-York, is about 1200 miles. To the
mouth of the Mississippi, by New-Orleans,
near 1600 miles, and to the mouth of the
St Lawrence, by Montreal, near 1600 miles.</p>

<p>The distance from Detroit to the ocean
by New-York, is near 700 miles. From
Detroit to the ocean by Montreal, is 1050
miles. From Detroit to the ocean, pursuing
the nearest route by Cleveland, and
down the Muskingum, 2400 miles. The
distance from Pittsburgh to the ocean, by
Le Beuf, lake, Buffalo, and New York, is
700 miles. The same to the ocean by
Buffalo and Montreal, 1050 miles. The
same to the ocean by the Ohio and Mississippi,
2150 miles.</p>

<p>These different comparative views show
that New-York has, in every instance, a
decided advantage over her great rivals.
In other essential respects the scale preponderates
equally in her favor. Supposing
a perfect equality of advantages as to
the navigation of the lakes, yet from
Buffalo, as the point of departure, there is
no comparison of benefits. From that
place the voyager to Montreal has to en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>counter
the inconveniences of a portage at
the cataract of Niagara, to load and unload
at least three times, to brave the tempests
of Lake Ontario and the rapids of the St
Lawrence. In like manner the voyager to
New-Orleans, has a portage between the
Chicago and Illinois, an inconvenient
navigation in the latter stream, besides the
well known obstacles and hazards of the
Mississippi. And until the invention of
steamboats, an ascending navigation was
considered almost impracticable. This inconvenience
is, however, still forcibly
experienced on that river, as well as on the
St Lawrence between Montreal and lake
Ontario.</p>

<p>The navigation from lake Erie to Albany,
can be completed in ten days with perfect
safety on the canal; and from Albany to
New-York, there is the best sloop navigation
in the world. From Buffalo to Albany,
a ton of commodities could be conveyed on
the intended canal, for three dollars, and
from Albany to New-York, according to
the present prices of sloop transportation,
for $2.80, and the return cargoes would be
the same. We have not sufficient data<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
upon which to predicate very accurate estimates
with regard to Montreal and New
Orleans; but we have no hesitation in saying,
that the descending conveyance to the
former, would be four times the expense,
and to the latter, at least ten times, and
that the cost of the ascending transportation
would be greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>It has been stated by several of the most
respectable citizens of Ohio, that the present
expense of transportation by water
from the city of New-York to Sandusky,
including the carrying places, is $4.50 per
hundred, and allowing it to cost two dollars
per hundred for transportation to Clinton,
the geographical centre of the state, the
whole expense would be $6.50, which is
only fifty cents more than the transportation
from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, and
at least $2.50 less than the transportation
by land and water from these places, and
that, in their opinion, New-York is the
natural emporium of that trade, and that
the whole commercial intercourse of the
western country north of the Ohio, will be
secured to her by the contemplated canal.</p>

<p>In addition to this, it may be stated that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the St Lawrence is generally locked up by
ice seven months in the year, during which
time produce lies a dead weight on the
hands of the owner; that the navigation
from New-York to the ocean, is at all times
easy, and seldom obstructed by ice, and
that the passage from the Balize to New-Orleans
is tedious; that perhaps one out of
five of the western boatmen who descend
the Mississippi, become victims to disease;
and that many important articles of western
production are injured or destroyed by the
climate. New-York is, therefore, placed
in a happy medium between the insalubrious
heat of the Mississippi, and the severe
cold of the St Lawrence. She has also
pre-eminent advantages, as to the goodness
and extensiveness of her market. All
the productions of the soil, and the fabrics
of art, can command an adequate price, and
foreign commodities can generally be procured
at a lower rate. The trade of the
Mississippi is already in the hands of her
merchants, and although accidental and
transient causes may have concurred to
give Montreal an ascendency in some
points, yet the superiority of New-York is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
founded in nature, and if improved by the
wisdom of government, must always soar
above competition.</p>

<p>Granting, however, that the rivals of
New-York will command a considerable
portion of the western trade, yet it must
be obvious, from these united considerations,
that she will engross more than
sufficient to render her the greatest commercial
city in the world. The whole line
of canal will exhibit boats loaded with
flour, pork, beef, pot and pearl ashes,
flaxseed, wheat, barley, corn, hemp, wool,
flax, iron, lead, copper, salt, gypsum, coal,
tar, fur, peltry, ginseng, bees-wax, cheese,
butter, lard, staves, lumber, and the other
valuable productions of our country; and
also, with merchandise from all parts of
the world. Great manufacturing establishments
will spring up; agriculture will
establish its granaries, and commerce its
warehouses in all directions. Villages,
towns, and cities, will line the banks of the
canal, and the shore of the Hudson from
Erie to New-York. &ldquo;The wilderness and
the solitary place will become glad, and the
desert will rejoice and blossom as the rose.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>While it is universally admitted that
there ought to be a water communication
between the great lakes and the tide waters
of the Hudson, a contrariety of opinion
(greatly to be deplored, as tending to injure
the whole undertaking) has arisen with
respect to the route that ought to be
adopted. It is contended on the one side,
that the canal should commence in the
vicinity of the outlet of lake Erie, and be
carried in the most eligible direction across
the country to the head waters of the
Mohawk river at Rome: from whence it
should be continued along the valley of
the Mohawk to the Hudson. It is, on the
other side, insisted, that it should be cut
around the cataract of Niagara; that lake
Ontario should be navigated to the mouth
of the Oswego river; that the navigation
of that river, and Wood creek, should be
improved and pursued until the junction of
the latter with the Mohawk at Rome. As
to the expediency of a canal from Rome to
the Hudson, there is no discrepance of
opinion: the route from Rome to the great
Lakes constitutes the subject of controversy.</p>

<p>If both plans were presented to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
legislature, as worthy of patronage, and if
the advocates of the route by lake Ontario
did not insist that their schemes should be
exclusive, and of course, that its adoption
should prove fatal to the other project, this
question would not exhibit so serious an
aspect. If two roads are made, that which
is most accommodating will be preferred;
but if only one is established, whether
convenient or inconvenient to individuals,
beneficial or detrimental to the public, it
must necessarily be used. We are so fully
persuaded of the superiority of the Erie
canal, that although we should greatly
regret so useless an expenditure of public
money as making a canal round the cataract
of Niagara, yet we should not apprehend
any danger from the competition of Montreal,
if the former were established.</p>

<p>The invincible argument in favor of the
Erie canal is, that it would diffuse the
blessings of internal navigation over the
most fertile and populous parts of the state,
and supply the whole community with salt,
gypsum, and in all probability coal.
Whereas the Ontario route would accommodate
but an inconsiderable part of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
territory, and instead of being a great
highway, leading directly to the object, it
would be a circuitous by-road, inconvenient
in all essential respects.</p>

<p>The most serious objection against the
Ontario route, is, that it will inevitably
enrich the territory of a foreign power, at
the expense of the United States. If a
canal is cut around the falls of Niagara,
and no countervailing nor counteracting
system is adopted in relation to lake Erie,
the commerce of the west is lost to us for
ever. When a vessel once descends into
Ontario, she will pursue the course ordained
by Nature. The British Government
are fully aware of this, and are now
taking the most active measures to facilitate
the passage down the St Lawrence.</p>

<p>It is not to be concealed, that a great
portion of the productions of our western
country are now transported to Montreal,
even with all the inconveniences attending
the navigation down the Seneca and
Oswego rivers; but if this route is improved
in the way proposed, and the other
not opened, the consequences will be most
prejudicial. A barrel of flour is now trans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ported
from Cayuga lake to Montreal for
$1.50, and it cannot be conveyed to Albany
for less than $2.50. This simple fact speaks
a volume of admonitory instruction. But
taking it for granted, that the Ontario
route will bring the commerce of the west
to New-York, yet the other ought to be
preferred, on account of the superior
facilities it affords.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is nearer. The distance
from Buffalo to Rome, is less than
200 miles in the course of the intended
canal: by lake Ontario and Oswego, it is
232.</p>

<p>2. A loaded boat could pass from Buffalo
to Rome by the Erie route, in less
than seven days, and with entire safety.
By the Ontario route, it will be perfectly
uncertain, and not a little hazardous.
After leaving Niagara river, it would have
to pass an inland sea to the extent of 127
miles, as boisterous and as dangerous as
the Atlantic. And besides a navigation of
at least twenty miles over another lake, it
would have to ascend two difficult streams
for 55 miles; no calculation could then be
made, either on the certainty or safety of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
this complicated and inconvenient navigation.</p>

<p>3. When a lake vessel would arrive at
Buffalo, she would have to unload her
cargo, and when this cargo arrived at
Albany by the Erie canal, it would be
shifted on board of a river-sloop, in order
to be transported to New-York. From the
time of the first loading on the great lakes,
to the last unloading at the storehouses in
New-York, there would be three loadings
and three unloadings on this route. But
when a lake vessel arrived with a view of
passing the canal of Niagara, she would be
obliged to shift her lading for that purpose,
for it would be almost impracticable
to use lake vessels on the Niagara river,
on account of the difficulty of the ascending
navigation. At Lewistown, or some
other place of the Niagara, another change
of the cargo on board of a lake vessel for
Ontario would be necessary: at Oswego
another, and at Albany another; so that on
this route there would be five loadings and
five unloadings before the commodities
were stored in New York. This difference
is an object of great consequence, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
presents the most powerful objections
against the Ontario route; for to the delay
we must add the accumulated expense of
these changes of the cargo, the storage,
the waste and damage, especially by theft
(where the chances of depredation are increased
by the merchandise passing through
a multitude of hands) and the additional
lake vessels, boats and men that will be
required, thereby increasing in this respect
alone, the cost two thirds above that attending
the other course. And in general
it may be observed, that the difference
between a single and double freight forms
an immense saving. Goods are brought
from Europe for twenty cents per cubic
foot; whereas the price from Philadelphia
to Baltimore, is equal to ten cents. This
shews how far articles once embarked, are
conveyed with a very small addition of
freight, and if such is the difference between
a single and a double freight, how
much greater must it be in the case under
consideration! If the fall from lake Erie
to lake Ontario be 450 feet, as stated in
Mr secretary Gallatin&rsquo;s report on canals, it
will require at least 45 locks for a naviga<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>tion
around the cataract. Whether it
would be practicable to accommodate all
the vessels which the population and opulence
of future times will create in those
waters, with a passage through so many
locks accumulated within a short distance,
is a question well worthy of serious consideration.
At all events, the demurrage
must be frequent, vexatious, and expensive.</p>

<p>When we consider the immense expense
which would attend the canal proposed on
the Niagara river; a canal requiring so
many locks, and passing through such
difficult ground; when we view the Oswego
river from its outlet at Oswego to its
origin in Oneida lake, encumbered with
dangerous rapids and falls, and flowing
through a country almost impervious to
canal operations; and when we contemplate
the numerous embarrassments which are
combined with the improvement of Wood
Creek, we are prepared to believe that the
expense of this route will not greatly fall
short of the other.</p>

<p>It is, however, alleged that it is not practicable
to make this canal; and that if prac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>ticable,
the expense will be enormous, and
will far transcend the faculties of the state.</p>

<p>Lake Erie is elevated 541 feet above the
tide waters at Troy. The only higher
ground between it and the Hudson is but a
few miles from the lake: and this difficulty
can be easily surmounted by deep cutting;
of course no tunnel will be required. The
rivers which cross the line of the canal,
can be easily passed by aqueducts; on
every summit level, plenty of water can be
obtained; whenever there is a great rise or
descent, locks can be erected, and the
whole line will not require more than
sixty-two; perhaps there is not an equal
extent of country in the world, which
presents fewer obstacles to the establishment
of a canal. The liberality of Nature
has created the great ducts and arteries,
and the ingenuities of art can easily provide
the connecting veins. The general
physiognomy of the country is champaign,
and exhibits abundance of water: a
gentle rising from the Hudson to the lake;
a soil well adapted for such operations: no
impassable hills, and no insurmountable
waters. As to distance, it is not to be con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>sidered
in relation to practicability. If a
canal can be made for fifty miles, it can be
made for three hundred, provided there is
no essential variance in the face of the
country; the only difference will be that
in the latter case, it will take more time,
and consume more money.</p>

<p>But this opinion does not rest for its support
upon mere speculation. Canals have
been successfully cut through more embarrassing
ground, in various parts of the
United States; and even in part of the
intended route from Schenectady to Rome,
locks have been erected at the Little Falls,
and at other places; and short canals have
been made, and all these operations have
taken place in the most difficult parts of
the whole course of the contemplated Erie
navigation. Mr. William Weston, one of
the most celebrated civil engineers in
Europe, who has superintended canals in
this state and Pennsylvania, and who is
perfectly well acquainted with the country
has thus expressed his opinion on the
subject: &ldquo;Should your noble but stupendous
plan of uniting Lake Erie with the
Hudson, be carried into effect, you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to fear no rivalry. The commerce of the
immense extent of country, bordering on
the upper lakes, is yours for ever, and to
such an incalculable amount as would baffle
all conjecture to conceive. Its execution
would confer immortal honor on the projectors
and supporters, and would in its
eventual consequences, render New-York
the greatest commercial emporium in the
world, with perhaps the exception, at some
distant day of New-Orleans, or some other
depot at the mouth of the majestic Mississippi.
From your perspicuous topographical
description and neat plan and profile of
the route of the contemplated canal, I entertain
little doubt of the practicability of
the measure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With regard to the expense of this work,
different estimates will be formed. The
commissioners appointed for that purpose
were of opinion that it would not cost more
than five millions of dollars. On this subject
we must be guided by the light which
experience affords in analogous cases.
The canal of Languedoc, or canal of the
two seas in France, connects the Mediterranean
and the Atlantic, and is 180 miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
in length: it has 114 locks and sluices, and
a tunnel 720 feet long. The breadth of
the canal is 144 feet, and its depth six
feet: it was begun in 1666, and finished in
1681, and cost &pound;540,000 sterling, or &pound;3,000
sterling a mile.</p>

<p>The Holstein canal, begun in 1777, and
finished in 1785, extends about fifty miles: is
100 feet wide at the top, and 54 at the bottom,
and not less than ten feet deep in any part.
Ships drawing nine feet four inches of
water, pass through it from the German
ocean, in the vicinity of Tonningen, into
the Baltic. From two to three thousand
ships have passed in one year. The expense
of the whole work was a little more
than a million and a half of dollars, which
would be at the rate of 30,000 dollars a
mile for this ship navigation.</p>

<p>The extreme length of the canal from
the Forth to the Clyde, in Scotland, is 35
miles. It rises and falls 160 feet by means
of 39 locks. Vessels pass drawing eight
feet water, having 19 feet beam, and 73 feet
length. The cost is calculated at &pound;200,000
sterling, which is at the rate of about
23,000 dollars a mile. But this was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
canal for ships drawing eight feet of water,
with an extraordinary rise for its length,
and having more than one lock for every
mile.</p>

<p>The following will give an idea of the
money expended on such works in England:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noidt">The miles of canal are 385&frac12;, and the
cost is &pound;2,411,900 sterling, or about 28,000
dollars per mile.</p>

<p>But in the estimation of the cost of these
canals, unquestionably the price of the land
over which they pass is included, and this
is enormous. The land alone for one canal
of 16 miles, is said to have cost &pound;90,000
sterling. With us this would be but
small. If we look at the history of the
English canals, we shall see how many
objects of great expense are connected with
them, with which we should have nothing
to do, and that most of them have encoun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>tered
and surmounted obstacles which we
should not meet with. For instance, the
Grand Junction canal passes more than
once the great ridge which divides the
waters of England; ours will pass over a
country which in comparison is champaign.</p>

<p>But it is said that the price of labor in
our country is so much above what it is in
England, that we must add greatly to the
cost of her canals in estimating the expense
of ours. But that is certainly a false conclusion,
for not only must the price of the
land and the adventitious objects which
have been before referred to, be deducted
from the cost of the foreign canals, but
we must consider that there will be almost
as great a difference in our favor in the cost
of the material and brute labor, as there is
in favor of England as to human labor, and
it is well known that so much human labor
is not now required on canals as formerly.
Machines for facilitating excavation have
been invented and used with great success.</p>

<p>Mr. Gallatin&rsquo;s report on canals contains
several estimates of the cost of contemplated
ones. From Weymouth to Taunton,
in Massachusetts, the expense of a canal of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
26 miles, with a lockage of 260 feet, is set
down at $1,250,000. From Brunswick to
Trenton, 28 miles, with a lockage of 100
feet, 800,000 dollars. From Christiana to
Elk, 22 miles with a lockage of 148 feet,
750,000 dollars. From Elizabeth river to
Pasquotank, 22 miles, with a lockage of 40
feet, 250,000 dollars. These estimates thus
vary from 48,000 to less than 12,000 dollars
a mile, and furnish the medium of about
31,000 dollars a mile. But it must be
observed that they are for small distances,
are calculated to surmount particular obstacles,
and contemplate an extraordinary
number of locks, and that they do not
therefore furnish proper data from which to
form correct conclusions, with respect to
the probable cost of an extensive canal,
sometimes running over a great number of
miles upon a level without any expense for
lockage, or any other expense than the
mere earthwork.</p>

<p>Mr. Weston, before mentioned, estimated
the expense of a canal from the tide waters
at Troy to lake Ontario, a distance of 160
miles, (exclusive of lake Oneida,) going
around the Cohoes, and embracing 55 locks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of eight feet lift each, at 2,200,000 dollars,
a little more than 13,000 dollars a mile.
Fortunately, however, we have more accurate
information than mere estimates.</p>

<p>In the appendix to Mr Gallatin&rsquo;s report, it
is stated by Mr Joshua Gilpin, that &ldquo;by
actual measurement, and the sums paid on
the feeder, it was found that one mile on
the Delaware and Chesapeake canal, the
most difficult of all others, from its being
nearly altogether formed through hard
rocky ground, cost 13,000 dollars, and one
other mile perfectly level, and without
particular impediments, cost 2,300 dollars;
from hence, the general average would be
reduced to 7,650 dollars per mile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Middlesex canal,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> in Massachusetts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
runs over twenty-eight miles of ground,
presenting obstacles much greater than can
be expected on the route we purpose.
This canal cost 478,000 dollars, which is
about 17,000 dollars a mile. It contains 22
locks of solid masonry and excellent workmanship
and to accomplish this work, it
was necessary to dig in some places to the
depth of 20 feet, to cut through ledges of
rocks, to fill some vallies and morasses, and
to throw several aqueducts across the
intervening rivers. One of these across
the river Shawshine is 280 feet long, and
22 feet above the river.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>This will require 62 locks of ten feet lift
each. The expense of such locks as experimentally
proved in several instances in
this state would be about 620,000 dollars.</p>

<p>We have seen that on the Middlesex
canal, there are 22 locks for 28 miles,
which is a lock for somewhat less than
every mile, whereas, 62 locks for 300 miles
is but about one lock for every five miles;
and the lockage of the Middlesex canal,
would alone cost 220,000 dollars. It would,
therefore, appear to be an allowance perhaps
too liberal, to consider the cost of it
as a fair criterion of the expense of canals
in general in this country, and of this in
particular. Reservoirs and tunnels, are the
most expensive part of the operation, and
none will be necessary in our whole route.
The expense of the whole earth work of
excavating a mile of canal on level ground
fifty feet wide and five feet deep, at 18
cents per cubic yard, and allowing for the
cost of forming and trimming the banks,
puddling, etc. will not exceed 4000 dollars
per mile, and the only considerable aqueduct
on the whole line, will be over the
Genesee river. From a deliberate consid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>eration
of these different estimates and
actual expenditures, we are fully persuaded
that this great work will not cost more than
20,000 dollars a mile, or six millions of
dollars in the whole; but willing to make
every possible allowance; and even conceding
that it will cost double that sum,
yet still we contend that there is nothing
which ought to retard its execution. The
canal cannot be made in a short time. It
will be the work perhaps of 10 or 15 years.</p>

<p>The money will not be wanted at once.
The expenditure, in order to be beneficial
ought not to exceed 500,000 dollars a year,
and the work may be accomplished in two
ways, either by companies, incorporated
for particular sections of the route, or by
the state. If the first is resorted to,
pecuniary sacrifices will still be necessary
on the part of the public, and great care
ought to be taken to guard against the high
tolls, which will certainly injure, if not
ruin the whole enterprise.</p>

<p>If the state shall see fit to achieve this
great work, there can be no difficulty in
providing funds. Stock can be created
and sold at an advanced price. The ways<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and means of paying the interest will be
only required. After the first year, supposing
an annual expenditure of 500,000
dollars, thirty thousand dollars must be
raised to pay an interest of six per cent;
after the second year 60,000, and so on.
At this rate of interest they will regularly
increase with beneficial appropriation, and
will be so little in amount that it may be
raised in many shapes without being burdensome
to the community. In all human
probability, the augmented revenue proceeding
from the public salt works, and the
increased price of the state lands, in consequence
of this undertaking, will more than
extinguish the interest of the debt contracted
for that purpose. We should also
take into view, the land already subscribed
by individuals for this work, amounting
to 106,632 acres. These donations, together
with those which may be confidently anticipated,
will exceed in value a million of dollars,
and it will be at all times in the
power of the state to raise a revenue from
the imposition of transit duties, which may
be so light as scarcely to be felt, and yet
the income may be so great, as in a short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
time to extinguish the debt, and this might
take effect on the completion of every important
section of the work.</p>

<p>If the legislature shall consider this important
project in the same point of view,
and shall unite with us in opinion, that the
general prosperity is intimately and essentially
involved in its prosecution, we are
fully persuaded that now is the proper time
for its commencement. Delays are the
refuge of weak minds, and to procrastinate
on this occasion is to show a culpable inattention
to the bounties of Nature; a total
insensibility to the blessings of Providence,
and an inexcusable neglect of the interests
of society. If it were intended to advance
the views of individuals, or to foment the
divisions of party; if it promoted the interests
of a few, at the expense of the prosperity
of many; if its benefits were limited
as to place, or fugitive as to duration,
then indeed it might be received with cold
indifference, or treated with stern neglect;
but the overflowing blessing from this
great fountain of public good and national
abundance, will be as extensive as our
country, and as durable as time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The considerations which now demand an
immediate, and an undivided attention to
this great object, are so obvious, so various,
and so weighty, that we shall only attempt
to glance at some of the most prominent.</p>

<p>In the first place, it must be evident,
that no period could be adopted in which
the work can be prosecuted with less expense.
Every day augments the value of
the land through which the canal will pass;
and when we consider the surplus hands
which have been recently dismissed from
the army into the walks of private industry,
and the facility with which an addition
can be procured to the mass of our active
labour, in consequence of the convulsions
of Europe, it must be obvious that this is
now the time to make those indispensable
acquisitions.</p>

<p>2. The longer this work is delayed, the
greater will be the difficulty in surmounting
the interests that will rise up in opposition
to it. Expedients on a contracted
scale have already been adopted for the
facilitations of intercourse. Turnpikes,
locks, and short canals, have been resorted
to, and in consequence of those establish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>ments,
villages have been laid out, and
towns have been contemplated. To prevent
injurious speculation, to avert violent
opposition, and to exhibit dignified impartiality
and fraternal affection to your fellow-citizens,
it is proper that they should be
notified at once of your intentions.</p>

<p>3. The experience of the late war has
impressed every thinking man in the community,
with the importance of this communication.
The expenses of transportation
frequently exceeded the original value
of the article, and at all times operated with
injurious pressure upon the finances of the
nation. The money thus lost for the want
of this communication, would have perhaps
defrayed more than one half of its expense.</p>

<p>4. Events which are daily occurring on
our frontiers, demonstrate the necessity of
this work. Is it of importance that our
honourable merchants should not be robbed
of their legitimate profits; that the public
revenues should not be seriously impaired
by dishonest smuggling, and that the commerce
of our cities should not be supplanted
by the mercantile establishments of foreign
countries? then it is essential that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
sovereign remedy for maladies so destructive
and ruinous should be applied. It is
with inconceivable regret we record the
well known fact, that merchandise from
Montreal has been sold to an alarming extent
in our borders, for 15 per cent below
the New-York prices.</p>

<p>5. A measure of this kind will have a
benign tendency in raising the value of the
national domains, in expediting the sale, and
enabling the payment. Our national debt
may thus, in a short time, be extinguished.
Our taxes of course will be diminished, and
a considerable portion of revenue may then
be expended in great public improvements;
in encouraging the arts and sciences; in
patronising the operations of industry; in
fostering the inventions of genius, and in
diffusing the blessings of knowledge.</p>

<p>6. However serious the fears which
have been entertained of a dismemberment
of the Union by collisions between the north
and the south, it is to be apprehended that
the most imminent danger lies in another
direction, and that a line of separation may
be eventually drawn between the atlantic
and the western states, unless they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
cemented by a common, an ever acting and
a powerful interest. The commerce of the
ocean, and the trade of the lakes, passing
through one channel, supplying the wants,
increasing the wealth, and reciprocating
the benefits of each great section of the
empire, will form an imperishable cement
of connexion, and an indissoluble bond of
union. New-York is both atlantic and
western, and the only state in which this
union of interest can be formed and perpetuated,
and in which this great centripetal
power can be energetically applied.
Standing on this exalted eminence, with
power to prevent a train of the most extensive
and afflicting calamities that ever
visited the world, (for such a train will
inevitably follow a dissolution of the
Union,) she will justly be considered an
enemy to the human race, if she does not
exert for this purpose the high faculties
which the Almighty has put into her hands.</p>

<p>Lastly. It may be confidently asserted,
that this canal, as to the extent of its route,
as to the countries which it connects, and
as to the consequences which it will produce,
is without a parallel in the history of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
mankind. The union of the Baltic and
Euxine; of the Red Sea and the Mediterranean;
of the Euxine and the Caspian;
and of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic,
has been projected or executed by the
chiefs of powerful monarchies, and the
splendor of the design has always attracted
the admiration of the world. It remains
for a free state to create a new era in history,
and to erect a work, more stupendous,
more magnificent, and more beneficial,
than has hitherto been achieved by the
human race. Character is as important to
nations as to individuals, and the glory of
a republic, founded on the promotion of
the general good, is the common property
of all its citizens.</p>

<p>We have thus discharged with frankness
and plainness, and with every sentiment of
respect, a great duty to ourselves, to our
fellow-citizens, and to posterity, in presenting
this subject to the fathers of the
commonwealth. And may that Almighty
Being, in whose hands are the destinies of
states and nations, enlighten your councils
and invigorate your exertions, in favour of
the best interests of our beloved country.</p>

<h3>PLANNING, BUILDING, AND OPENING</h3>


<p>By an act of the New York legislature
of April 17, 1816,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the canal commissioners
were ordered to send to
the legislature &ldquo;a plain and comprehensive
Report of their proceedings;&rdquo; their duty
was to find a route for the projected canal,
estimate the expense, ascertain on what
terms the state of New York could secure
loans, and to apply for donations of both
land and money.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The committee met at New York May
17, 1816, and organized. The proposed line
of the canal was divided into three sections
and an engineer was appointed for each.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
The Western Section embraced the portion
of the route between Lake Erie and the
Seneca River; the Middle Section was that
between the Seneca River and Rome on
the Mohawk; the Eastern Section extended
from Rome to Albany on the Hudson.
The only point at which there was serious
question as to the best route of the canal
was between Lake Erie and the Genesee
country; and the question was whether to
pass south or north of the &ldquo;mountain
ridge&rdquo; which lay south of the shore of
Lake Ontario. Four engineers were sent
to make an examination. Two commissioners
and engineers were sent to inspect
the Middlesex Canal in Massachusetts,
&ldquo;the best artificial navigation in the United
States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The commissioners met again July 15,
after which three of them went to inspect
the important portions of a canal route
which was now being marked out by the
corps of surveyors from Lake Erie to the
Mohawk. The size of the canal proposed
was forty feet wide on water surface,
twenty-eight feet wide at the base and
four feet deep&mdash;capable of handling boats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of one hundred tons. The locks were to
be ninety feet long, twelve feet in width
in the clear. These would accommodate
any lumber that was then being shipped
from the regions tapped by the canal.
The route of the canal survey was
being marked by &ldquo;bench marks, level
pegs, and other fixtures; ... Shafts
have been sunk into the earth in various
places, to ascertain its nature, with a view
to a just estimation of the labour required,
and of the expense to be incurred.&rdquo; The
point of junction with Lake Erie, forever
a doubtful point until the very last, was
now planned at the mouth of Buffalo Creek;
the water was higher there, of course,
than at any point in the Niagara River,
&ldquo;and every inch gained in elevation will
produce a large saving in the expense of
excavation throughout the Lake Erie level.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The Western Section, from Buffalo to
the eastern line of the Holland Purchase,
was explored by Engineer William Peacock
and Joseph Ellicott, commissioner. Their
estimate for the sixty-two miles from
Buffalo to the east end of the summit level
west of the Genesee River, east of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the Great Tonawanda Swamp, was $450,000,
and for the total distance to the Genesee
River, $780,000. The absence of water on
this route made reservoirs necessary, which
formed a strong objection to pursuing that
course. Anticipating this, Engineer James
Geddes was sent over another course from
a point twelve miles up the Tonawanda to
the Seneca River. The distance was one
hundred and thirty-six miles; the rise of
one hundred and ninety-four feet from
Seneca River to Lake Erie was to be overcome
by twenty-five locks; the total expense
was put at $1,550,985. The Middle
Section extended from Seneca River to
Rome, with a decline of forty-eight and
one-half feet in seventy-seven miles. It
was surveyed and laid out by Benjamin
Wright; the estimate included $1,500 per
mile for grubbing, so heavy were the
forests, and reached a total of $853,186,
which was considered liberal. The Eastern
Section from Rome to Albany was surveyed
in part by Engineer Charles C.
Broadhead. The seventy odd miles to
Schoharie Creek, with a descent of 132.85
feet, called for sixteen locks and forty-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
bridges&mdash;a total expenditure of $1,090,603.
The forty-two miles to Albany were not
now surveyed; the estimate for this distance
was $1,106,087. The total descent of
the canal from Lake Erie to the Hudson
was 564.85 feet and its length was about
363 miles. The average estimated cost
per mile was $13,800&mdash;by the route north
of the Genesee River.</p>

<p>The Erie Canal was born in the Act of
April 15, 1817.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> After being passed by
the legislature it went before the Council
of Revision. &ldquo;The ordeal this bill met
with in the Council of Revision, came near
being fatal to it; it could not have received
a two-thirds vote after a veto. The Council
was composed of Lieutenant-Governor
John Tayler, acting Governor, as President
of the Council, Chief Justice Thompson,
Chancellor Kent, and Judges Yates
and Platt. Acting Governor Tayler was
openly opposed to the whole scheme. The
Chief Justice was also opposed to this bill.
Chancellor Kent was in favor of the canal,
but feared it was too early for the State to
undertake this gigantic work. Judges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Yates and Platt were in favor of the bill;
but it was likely to be lost by the casting
vote of the acting Governor. Vice President
Tompkins (recently the Governor)
entered the room at this stage of the proceedings,
and, in an informal way, joined
in conversation upon the subject before the
Council, and in opposition to this bill. He
said &lsquo;The late peace with Great Britain was
a mere truce, and we will undoubtedly
soon have a renewed war with that country;
and instead of wasting the credit and
resources of the State in this chimerical
project, we ought to employ all our
revenue and credit in preparing for war.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you think so, sir?&rsquo; said Chancellor
Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied the Vice President;
&lsquo;England will never forgive us for our
victories, and, my word for it, we shall
have another war, with her within two
years.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chancellor, then rising from his
seat, with great animation declared,</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If we must have war ... I
am in favor of the canal and I vote for the
bill.&rsquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;With that vote the bill became a law.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Preliminary work was immediately begun
in the early spring of 1817 at the strategic
summit level at Rome by conducting &ldquo;a
careful re-examination of the line of the
canal, and of the levels of the preceding
year.&rdquo; This reconsideration seemed to
indicate that a longer summit level at
Rome than the one selected should be
made, and Utica was chosen as the eastern
extremity of this level rather than Rome.
This decision was enforced by the fact that
Mohawk navigation above Utica was always
more uncertain than at any point below it;
if the canal for instance should terminate
at the Mohawk because of lack of means,
or other cause, it would be advantageous
to have its terminus on the Mohawk at a
point where navigation was as uniformly
reliable as possible. The Western Inland
Lock Navigation Company had often found
it necessary to make a portage from Utica
to Rome, such was the low stage of water in
the Mohawk. The summit level chosen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
therefore, ran from Utica to the salt-works
at Salina (Syracuse). This was the eastern
summit. The western was yet to be chosen
between the Genesee and the Niagara tributaries
in western New York.</p>

<p>Five lines of stakes were now driven
into the ground from the eastern to the
western boundaries of the state of New
York&mdash;a circumstance which must be considered
epoch-making in the history of
America. For, look at it as you will, the
beginning of the Erie Canal must be considered
a greater marvel than the building
of it. It would be difficult now to propose an
engineering feat that is within the range of
sanity that would provoke so much ridicule
and debate as did the plan to build the
Erie Canal through those hundreds of
miles of dense forests and reeking swamps
in 1816. A bridge across the Atlantic or a
tunnel underneath it could scarcely provoke
more sneers today. Yet the summer
of 1817 saw the rows of stakes driven into
the ground&mdash;over hill and vale, through
densest forest and sickliest swamp, from
east to west; the outer rows were sixty
feet apart and indicated the space to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
grubbed; between these were two other
rows forty feet apart which indicated the
exact dimensions of the canal; a single row
of stakes in the middle marked the exact
center of the canal. Those who laughed
at the stakes grew sober when men came
on over the route boring with four inch
augers into the ground every few rods to a
depth of twelve feet; by this means the
nature of the soil was tested all along the
route and estimates could be made of the
cost of the digging; thereupon profiles
could be drawn by the engineers. Each of
the three great sections of the canal was
subdivided into very small sections which
were to be let to contractors; each working
section was bounded, when possible, by a
brook or ravine, in order that each contractor
might have the advantage of independent
drainage. The plan of the state&rsquo;s
furnishing the tools for the work of digging
the canal was soon changed, the contractors
being expected to furnish their own
tools. An instance of the skill of the old
Erie Canal engineers, in a day when &ldquo;surveying&rdquo;
was as loose a word as the dictionary
contained, is interesting: &ldquo;While<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Benjamin Wright, Esquire, was re-examining
and laying off sections from Rome,
west along the canal line, it was deemed
expedient, as a test to the accuracy of the
work, that James Geddes, Esquire, should
start, at a given point on the canal line at
Rome, and carry a level along the road to
the east end of Oneida Lake, marking on
permanent objects the height of the surface
of the water while the lake was tranquil,
at various places from the east to the west
end, along its southern shore; that he
should then connect by a level, the Oneida
with the Onondaga Lake; after which he
was to carry a level from the last mentioned
lake, at Salina, south about one and a
fourth miles to the canal line, and from
thence to work to the east, laying off sections
along the canal line. This was accomplished,
and nine miles at the west end
of the summit level were laid out into sections.
And the commissioners have the
satisfaction to state, that when the level of
Mr. Wright had been carried along the
canal line, to the place where Mr. Geddes
had terminated his line, the levels of these
engineers, which embraced a circuit ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of nearly one hundred miles, differed from
each other less than one and an half
inches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first contract for work on the Erie
Canal was signed June 27, 1817. Work
was not begun until a formal inaugural
celebration at Rome, New York, July 4,
1817.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">A Canal Lock at Rome, New York, Touching the Site of Fort Stanwix</span>
</div>

<p>The authorities of Rome arranged with
the canal commissioners to unite the celebrations
of the opening of the canal with
the annual Fourth of July holiday. &ldquo;At
the appointed time and place, Judge Hathaway,
President of the village, made a short
address, adapted to the occasion, and then
delivered the spade into the hands of the
Commissioners. After a short but graphic
speech by the Commissioner Young, he
handed the spade to Judge Richardson, the
first contractor, who then thrust it into the
ground and made the first excavation for
the construction of the canal. The example
was immediately followed by his own
laborers, and by the assembled citizens,
all ambitious of the honor of participating
in the labors of that memorable occasion.
Thus amid the roar of artillery, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
acclamations of the people, was begun that
great work which has spread civilization,
wealth and refinement....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Thousands were ready to jump at the
chance of securing contracts on the great
work; money was scarce along the countryside
and means to make it proportionately
few; as was the case in the building
of the Cumberland Road, a great contemporary
work to the south, so the Erie
Canal was an immediate boon to hundreds
in that long strip of country through
which the lines of stakes were driven.
Most of the contractors were well-to-do New
York farmers, and three-fourths of the
army of laborers which now attacked the
long task were native born; the foreign
element which played so large a part in
making the Cumberland Road did not
figure in the building of the Erie Canal.
Angry gangs of mutinous foreign laborers
did not menace the first travelers on the
Erie Canal. The commissioners had the
good sense to mark out the work to be done
in such a way that worthy men of little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
capital could secure contracts; accordingly
the distances to be contracted for were
divided up and men of small or no means
at all were enabled to secure contracts as
well as great contractors with armies of
workmen in their employ. Money was
frequently advanced to contractors in sums
of from $200 to $2,000 according to the
size of the contract. Good security was
demanded. The commissioners, on the
other hand, were warned to look out for
rascally men who appear whenever any
great work is to be undertaken. In building
locks and embankments there was
ample opportunity for deceit and dishonesty,
which was an item to be reckoned
with.</p>

<p>During the first season of work fifty-eight
miles on the summit level were placed
under contract, but most of the contractors
were compelled to cease work when the
frosts came. In December, 1817, from $200
to $1,000 each was advanced to contractors
with which to buy provisions for their
men; beef, pork, and flour were cheaper
at this season than in the spring, and the
roads over which they were to be trans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>ported
were likewise better in the winter
season than at any other. This first year
of work had brought its lessons; first and
foremost it proved what a tremendous
burden lay on the shoulders of the commissioners
and engineers. Contracts innumerable
were to be made and signed,
calling for the provision of a hundred
necessities: principally for stone, lumber,
and lime; the proper quantities were to be
deposited at the proper places&mdash;here in a
heavy forest, there beside a swamp, and
yonder at the foot of a hill. The country
was quite innocent of anything that approached
such a road as was needed everywhere
along the line of work. It is difficult
even to hint at the multitude of perplexing
questions that the builders of the Erie
Canal faced and somehow solved. The
year had proved the advisability of discarding
the spade and wheelbarrow&mdash;the
European implements for canal building&mdash;for
the plough and scraper. With the latter
tools the work was more quickly done
and better; the feet of the horses drawing
them tended to solidify the earth along
the embankments. Three Irishmen fin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>ished
three rods of the canal, four feet
deep in five and one-half days. Sixteen
and one-half days work accomplished 249&frac12;
cubic yards of canal, which at twelve and
one-half cents per yard made $1.80 for
each man per day. As the year progressed
it was found that the contracts were inside
of the figures of the estimates originally
made.</p>

<p>When the season of 1818 was on, between
two and three thousand men and half that
number of horses and cattle were at work.
Indeed some of the contractors had worked
all winter, and many had transported the
necessary provisions and tools for the summer&rsquo;s
campaign to the points of work on
sleds during the winter. The Genesee
Road between Utica and Syracuse, the
most important of all, was useless for heavy
loads in the summer season. During this
season the entire Middle Section was put
under contract; the only important change
of route was at the Marl Meadows near
Camillus; this swamp without an outlet
was avoided by running a new route
through the Salina plains, at an estimated
saving of some $17,000.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>In all the romantic story of the building
of this great work nothing is so picturesque
as the forest scenes; the digging and scraping,
the hauling and cementing, is all commonplace
beside throwing the canal across
the tremendous forests which were now,
in 1818, to be met in that smiling country
of which Utica, Syracuse and Rochester are
the jewels of today. Nothing like this had
been attempted in America before the Erie
Canal; true the Cumberland Road was
crawling away across the Alleghenies and
was now in calling distance of Wheeling on
the Ohio; yet this road was built largely
on the route of older thoroughfares, and
much of its new bed ran through open
lands which pioneer fires had partially
cleared. Moreover it was built on the
surface of the ground. The Erie Canal
forged straight on where no foot but the
silent hunter&rsquo;s had stepped; its course was
marked in forests so dark that the surveyor&rsquo;s
stakes could hardly be distinguished
in the gloom&mdash;where not even the smoke
of a pioneer&rsquo;s fire had ever penetrated; it
was not built on the ground, but dug
through the ground, and the vast network<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
above ground in those ancient woods was
not less easily penetrated than was the
straggling mass of root and fiber that was
found for many feet below the surface.
No work in America before its time began
to compare in magnitude with grubbing
that sixty-foot aisle from Lake Erie to the
Hudson and the digging of a forty-foot
canal in its center.</p>

<p>Since necessity is the mother of invention,
it is not strange that here in the New
York woods should have been perfected
some strange machinery&mdash;great tugging
monsters which should bodily haul down
immense trees with a crash and pluck out
green stumps with single groan. It may
be these engines of forestry were imported
from Europe; we know from the correspondence
of that indefatigable promoter,
Washington, that great engines for clearing
trees from forest land were known in
Europe and were probably imported to
America not long after the Revolutionary
War.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> &ldquo;Machinery has hitherto been
used,&rdquo; recorded the commissioners of the
Erie Canal, &ldquo;with most success, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
heavy business of grubbing and clearing.
By means of an endless screw, connected
with a cable, a wheel and a crank, one
man is able to bring down a tree of the
largest size, without any cutting about its
roots. For this purpose these means are
all, except the cable, combined in a small
but very strong frame of wood and iron.&mdash;This
frame is immovably fastened on the
ground, at a distance of perhaps one hundred
feet from the foot of the tree, around
the trunk of which fifty or sixty feet up,
one end of the cable is secured, the other
being connected with the roller. When
this is done, the man turns the crank,
which successively moves the screw, the
wheel and the roller, on which, as the cable
winds up, the tree must gradually yield,
until, at length, it is precipitated by the
weight of its top. The force which may be
exerted in this way, upon a tree, is irresistible,
as with the principle of the wheel
and the screw, by the application of the
cable at a point so far from the ground, it
unites also that of the lever.&rdquo; The machine
for hauling stumps is thus described:
&ldquo;Two strong wheels, sixteen feet in diame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>ter,
are made and connected together by a
round axle-tree, twenty inches thick and
thirty feet long; between these wheels, and
with its spokes inseparably framed into
their axle-tree, another wheel is placed,
fourteen feet in diameter, round the rim of
which a rope is several times passed, with
one end fastened through the rim, and with
the other end loose, but in such a condition
as to produce a revolution of the wheel
whenever it is pulled. This apparatus is
so moved as to have the stump, on which
it is intended to operate, midway between
the largest wheels, and nearly under the
axle-tree; and these wheels are so braced
as to remain steady. A very strong chain
is hooked, one end to the body of the
stump, or its principal root, and the other
to the axle-tree. The power of horses or
oxen is then applied to the loose end of
the rope above-mentioned, and as they
draw, rotary motion is communicated,
through the smallest wheel, to the axle-tree,
on which, as the chain hooked to
the stump winds up, the stump itself is
gradually disengaged from the earth in
which it grew. After this disengagement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
is complete, the braces are taken from the
large wheels, which then afford the means
of removing that stump out of the way, as
well as of transporting the apparatus where
it may be made to bear on another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A plough was invented for cutting the
tangled meshes of roots below the turf
&ldquo;greatly superior to the one in common
use. It is very narrow or thin, and consists
of a piece of iron much heavier than
a common plough, strongly connected, at
its upper edge, with the beam, and in the
rear, with the handle, both of which are of
the usual construction. The front edge
of the iron, where the cutting is to be
done, is covered with steel, well sharpened
and shaped like the front of a coulter,
except that it retreats more as it rises to
the beam. The lower edge is made smooth
and gradually thickens as it extends back
towards the handle, to about four inches.
Two yoke of oxen will draw this utensile
through any roots not exceeding two inches
in diameter; and by moving it, at short
intervals, through the surface of the ground
to be excavated, the small roots and fibres
are so cut up as to be easily picked and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
harrowed out of the way of the shovel and
scraper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the season of 1818, all but five
of the ninety-four miles of Middle Section
were grubbed and cleared with these powerful
machines; little the wonder, however,
for one of the stump machines, costing
two hundred and fifty dollars, operated by
seven men and two horses, could grub
from thirty to forty large stumps a day. Of
the eighty-nine miles cleared, forty-eight
miles of the line was dug, eight miles
being completed and accepted. One ten-mile
stretch was half done and one twenty-mile
division was one-fourth done. The
total estimated expense of the Middle
Section was $1,021,851; up to January 25,
1819, $578,549 had been expended; the
$443,302 remaining was considered sufficient
to complete the section.</p>

<p>This division of the canal was completed
in 1819; for twenty-seven miles it was
navigable and had not the frost intervened,
large boats could have traversed its entire
length before the close of the year. The
expense proved to total up to $1,125,983,
an excess over the estimate of $104,132.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
The explanation of this excess brings out
some interesting facts concerning the progress
of the work. For instance, the aqueducts
over Oneida and Onondaga Creeks
had been made of solid masonry instead of
wood as stipulated in the estimate. Lack
of snow during the winter of 1818-19 had
prevented the hauling of much of the
needed material. Sickness among the army
of workmen had produced costly delays;
pioneer conditions prevailed&mdash;the fever
and ague of those who first invaded the
sluggish morasses of the interior of a new
continent. Special trouble had been experienced
where the canal line approached
the low-lying valley of the sluggish Seneca.
For thirty-five miles the works paralleled
this stream, and pioneers here suffered
heavily every fall; of course the laborers
on the canal were, to say the least, not
more fortified against the miasma and fever
than the pioneers who came more or less
prepared for such drawbacks. At one time
a thousand men on the Erie Canal were
stricken down in this region, and in some
instances the work on certain &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; was
entirely abandoned for several weeks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>But the work of the year was not confined
to the Middle Section. Exploring
parties had been sent to outline more
specifically the canal line in the sections
on either side. A portion of the Western
Section, from the Genesee River to Palmyra,
was put under contract, to be completed
in September, 1821. The portion
of the Eastern Section between Utica and
Little Falls&mdash;a distance of twenty-six
miles&mdash;was also put under contract. The
expenses for the year amounted to over
$100,000 ahead of the annual appropriation
of $600,000. And heavier expenses yet
were in sight; among these the claims of
the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company
had to be satisfied. This company
had been carrying on its business and declaring
greater dividends each year up to
1818. In that year the Erie Canal works
at Wood Creek interrupted the operation
of their system and the state was compelled
to satisfy the claim. There had been, ever
since 1812, a correspondence between the
canal commissioners and the Western Company
looking toward a purchase of the latter&rsquo;s
rights. The price asked in 1812, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
again in 1817, was $190,000. The matter
was at last settled in 1820 by the payment
of $152,718.52.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> There was a moment just
here when the canal came near pausing in
its swift rush to completion. A recasting
of the estimates was essayed, and the New
York legislature demanded of the commissioner
what portion of the canal was most
important in case only a part could be completed.
The reply was, of course, that the
Western Section should be finished whether
the Eastern could be or not. The estimated
expense of completing the canal 254
miles from Utica to Lake Erie was $2,845,561;
the Eastern Section, only ninety-eight
miles long, would cost only $800,000
less, and for this distance the Mohawk
River could be made to answer the purpose
of a canal if necessary.</p>

<p>But as if pushed forward by the very
momentum of its greatness, the canal went
forward. The advances made in 1820 were
rapid and important. In the Western Section
the fifty odd miles between the Genesee
and Montezuma were completed with the
exception of nine. The route of 1816 was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
hardly changed except at Irondequoit
Creek, and between Palmyra and Lyons.
The Middle Section rapidly became a busy
avenue. Mile posts were erected throughout
its length, the distance from Genesee
Street in Utica to the lock into the Seneca
River being a little more than ninety-six
miles. Navigation began in May. Contracts
were let for the Eastern Section that
would insure the completion of the thirty
miles from Utica to Minden within the
year. The course of the canal through the
Mohawk Valley was resurveyed, the experienced
engineer Canvass White pushing it
forward to Cohoes Falls. The great rock
wall at Little Falls was now completed.
At the close of the year ninety-eight miles
of the Erie Canal was completed, and the
promise was that as much more would be
done within a twelvemonth. The point
of difficulty now was in the Western Section
in gaining a route well supplied with
water between Lake Erie and the Middle
Section. During the present year Mr.
Thomas had surveyed the northern route,
running seventy-two miles from the
Tonawanda to the Genesee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>The contracts for this route were let in
1821, eighty miles being let in contracts.
The fifty miles between the Genesee and
Seneca were completed this year. Business
was more brisk on the completed Middle
Section than in the year previous, the tolls
received amounting to $23,001.63. Contracts
were let for the entire completion of
the Eastern Section, and boats were
already running from Utica to Little Falls.
A large fraction of the excavating between
Little Falls and Schenectady had been completed
by the last of the year, and the difficult
problem of a route from Cohoes Falls
to Albany was now solved by Canvass
White by crossing the Mohawk.</p>

<p>By June, 1823, the canal was open from
Rochester to Schenectady, and when the
season opened 220 miles were navigable.
During 1822 all but ten miles of the route
along the Niagara River had been put under
contract and the great Genesee aqueduct
had been erected. Toll to the extent
of $3,286 was collected in this year on the
eastern part of the Western Section&mdash;at
Lyons, Palmyra, and Rochester. By the
middle of November water had been ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>mitted
into the Eastern Section and boats
were afloat from Little Falls to Schenectady.
Water was admitted into the stretch
of canal between Brockport and Rochester,
October 10, 1823. The forty-five miles
from Brockport to the Mountain Ridge
(Lockport) was well along; the four great
embankments in this distance were nearly
complete; that at Sandy Creek was the
highest on the entire canal, running up
seventy-six feet. The tolls in 1823 between
the Genesee and Seneca amounted to
$20,954.11, showing the large amount of
business done.</p>

<p>As the last year before completion (1824)
opened, all eyes were directed to two
points in the west which were each difficult
puzzles. One was the means of crossing
the Mountain Ridge at Lockport and the
other was the best way to get into Lake
Erie. Finally the latter question was settled
for better or for worse by letting the
contracts for the Black Rock harbor. The
work went slowly at the Mountain Ridge,
but the contractors promised that the work
there would be completed by May, 1825.
The tolls this year between Mantz and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Utica amounted to $77,593.26, and the tolls
on the Eastern Section totaled up to
$27,444.09. Water was admitted into the
canal between Schenectady and Albany in
October; the work here, which included
twenty-nine locks, had been found unexpectedly
difficult. On October 8, 1823, the
first boats passed from the West and the
North (Lake Champlain canal) through the
junction canal into the tide water of the
Hudson at Albany. On September 8, 1824,
water was sent into the canal from Brockport
and Lockport; the line to Black Rock
and the Black Rock harbor was completed
nearly on scheduled time. Among improvements
of the year must be named the
hydrostatic locks built at Utica and Syracuse.
The tolls of 1824 were $294,546.62.
The grand canal was completed.</p>

<p>The completion was a signal for a royal
celebration throughout the state of New
York which is, in many aspects, of great
historic interest.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Its unique details, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
non-participation of many, the violent rejoicings
of others, the carrying out of symbolic
ceremonies not unlike Roman pageants,
all these and many other features of
the great show have a deep significance.
The political element entered largely into
the matter.</p>

<p>Learning that the canal would be completed
about October 26, the corporation
of New York City entered into correspondence
with the chief cities and towns along
the line concerning the proper celebration
of the event. Two aldermen, King and
Davis, were sent to Buffalo from New York
to participate in the festivities of the great
occasion.</p>

<p>Buffalo was in gala dress on the day set
for the pageant. The city was filled with
yeomanry. At nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning
the grand procession formed before the
court-house; the Buffalo band, squads of
riflemen, and the committees took the lead
and the vast throng moved to the head of
the Erie Canal where the canal-boat
&ldquo;Seneca Chief&rdquo; lay at anchor. Governor
Clinton, the lieutenant-governor, and the
committees were received on board, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Jesse Hawley, who, nearly a generation
before, had published in Pittsburg the first
broadside in favor of the canal, delivered
an address in behalf of the citizens of
Rochester, &ldquo;to mingle and reciprocate
their mutual congratulations with the citizens
of Buffalo on this grand effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Seneca Chief&rdquo; was bravely
equipped and manned for the occasion.
Two great paintings occupied conspicuous
positions. One presented the scene which
was at the moment being enacted, Buffalo
Creek and harbor with the canal in the
foreground and the &ldquo;Seneca Chief&rdquo; moving
away. The other picture represented
Governor Clinton as Hercules, in Roman
costume resting from hard labor. Among
the articles of freight to be carried by this
boat, which should first pass from Buffalo
to New York over the Erie canal, were
two kegs filled with Lake Erie water. In
addition to the governor of the state and
his staff, the Buffalo committee embarked
on the &ldquo;Seneca Chief,&rdquo; comprising Hon.
Judge Wilkinson, Captain Joy, Colonel
Potter, Major Burt, Colonel Dox, and Doctor
Stagg. The flotilla, which was headed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
by the &ldquo;Seneca Chief,&rdquo; consisted of the
canal-boats &ldquo;Chief,&rdquo; &ldquo;Superior,&rdquo; &ldquo;Commodore
Perry&rdquo; (a freight boat), and the
&ldquo;Buffalo&rdquo; (of Erie, Pennsylvania).
&ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo; was the name of another
craft which contained beasts, birds and
creeping things&mdash;a bear, two eagles, two
fawns, several fish, and two Indian boys, all
traveling under the title of &ldquo;products of
the West.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the flotilla set sail a signal gun
was discharged at Buffalo; the announcement
was taken up by each gun in a long
line from Buffalo to New York and the
signal was passed throughout the entire
distance.</p>

<p>As the pageant moved along through the
state it was joined ever and anon by other
craft and at almost every village exercises
and illuminations were the order of the
day and the much-feted governor and committees
were hauled to the best hotel and
feasted. The &ldquo;Niagara&rdquo; joined the squadron
at Black Rock and &ldquo;fell in behind.&rdquo;
At Lockport guns captured by Perry at the
battle of Lake Erie were fired in salute to
the guests and the occasion; a gunner who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
it was said, had fought under Napoleon,
discharged them. At Holley an address
was given on the twenty-seventh. At
Brockport cannon welcomed the boats.
There was a procession at Newport, as
everywhere else where the guests were
feted. At Rochester a <i>feu de joie</i> was fired
from the aqueduct on the arrival of the
triumphal flotilla, and here a fine boat, the
&ldquo;Young Lion of the West,&rdquo; rode out to
meet it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who comes there?&rdquo; cried the &ldquo;Young
Lion&rsquo;s&rdquo; sentinel as the strangers drew near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Brothers from the West, on the
waters of the great Lakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By what means have they been diverted
so far from their natural course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the channel of the Grand Erie
Canal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By whose authority, and by whom,
was a work of such magnitude accomplished?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the authority and by the enterprise
of the patriotic People of the State of New
York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The procession being formed, the vast
throng marched to the Presbyterian church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
where an address was delivered by Timothy
Childs. General Matthews, assisted by
Jesse Hawley, presided at a banquet which
followed at one of the hotels. Grand
illuminations and a ball concluded the
day&rsquo;s entertainment. The Rochester committee
consisting of Messrs. E. B. Strong,
Ward, Leavett, Rochester, Hulbert, Reynolds,
A. Strong, R. Beach, Johnson, and
E. S. Beach, embarked on the &ldquo;Young
Lion&rdquo; for New York.</p>

<p>At Palmyra an arch across the canal
welcomed the pageant on the twenty-eighth;
it read &ldquo;Clinton and the Canal&rdquo;
from one side, and &ldquo;Internal Improvements&rdquo;
on the reverse. Another arch at
Montezuma, which was reached late that
evening, was a transparency displaying the
words &ldquo;De Witt Clinton and Internal
Improvements&rdquo; on one side, and &ldquo;Union
of the East and West&rdquo; on the other.</p>

<p>Buckville was found brightly illuminated
at midnight; Port Byron was reached on
the twenty-ninth and Weedsport was illuminated.
A twenty-four pounder was
discharged, resulting in the death of only
two. Syracuse was reached on the thir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>tieth;
Joshua Forman, the early champion
of the canal in 1810, gave an address to
which Governor Clinton made reply.</p>

<p>At Rome probably the first indication of
ill-feeling was met; exercises had been
held on the twenty-sixth to commemorate
the opening of the canal, but dissatisfaction
was felt over the fact that the Erie
Canal did not follow the route of the old
Western Inland Lock Navigation Company
canal upon which the village of Rome had
grown up. In consequence, at 11 A. M.
on the twenty-sixth, a procession was
formed bearing a black barrel filled with
water from the old canal. Drums were
muffled and the procession moved slowly
out of town to the Erie Canal into which
the barrel was emptied. The return march
was made at quick step and at the hotel an
appropriate celebration was held. The
present flotilla arrived on Sunday, the
thirtieth, and remained only an hour.
Utica was reached at noon on this date;
during the exercises held on the morrow,
Governor Clinton took occasion to pay high
tribute to Utica&rsquo;s citizen, Judge Platt, who
had long befriended the canal movement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Little Falls was reached Monday evening;
here, too, a change of route displeased
some; the old Lock Company canal was on
the north side of the Mohawk, and the Erie
Canal was on the south side; a banquet
was served the guests at one of the hotels.
At three o&rsquo;clock Tuesday afternoon, Schenectady
was reached&mdash;two hours ahead of
scheduled time. Here a grave reception
awaited the enthusiastic voyageurs; a local
paper had mentioned &ldquo;a project of a funeral
procession, or some other demonstration
of mourning.&rdquo; No preparation for
the reception of the visitors had been
made. The canal would, it was believed,
be the ruin of Schenectady; as the terminus
of the old overland portage of sixteen miles
from Albany, the town had grown in
size and wealth; a large part of all the
freight from the south that passed up the
Mohawk came by wagon to Schenectady
and was there loaded on boats. The village
was, on one hand, a Mecca for wagon
lines and wagons, and on the other the
terminus of Mohawk shipping. The Erie
Canal overturned everything. A waterway
was now opened straight through to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Albany; Cohoes Falls, which had been the
making of Schenectady, was wiped out of
existence by the Erie Canal and the Schenectady
of the old days was a thing of the
past. The students of Union College,
however, were cosmopolitan, and the &ldquo;College
Guards&rdquo; did the honors of the rainy
day; the guests took dinner at a hotel and
were off at four o&rsquo;clock. On the following
morning, above the patroon mansion of
General Stephen Van Rensselaer, the
flotilla was met by the aldermen of Albany
and the last lock in the long canal was
entered at 10:30 A. M. Twenty-four cannon
announced the flotilla&rsquo;s arrival. The
procession that soon formed moved slowly
to the capital; after a prayer and an ode,
the address of the day was delivered by
Philip Hone.</p>

<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock on Thursday morning,
November 3, the flotilla set sail from
Albany on the broad Hudson; the canal
boats were in tow of strong steamers, the
&ldquo;Chancellor Livingston&rdquo; leading the way.
Unfortunately &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo; with its bears
and Indians had not kept up with the main
procession and did not arrive in time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
start for New York. The steamers swept
the boats rapidly onward; they were saluted
at Catskill, West Point and Newburgh, and
arrived at New York at daylight of November
4, anchoring near the state prison.</p>

<p>The steamer &ldquo;Washington,&rdquo; magnificently
decorated, came alongside the &ldquo;Chancellor
Livingston&rdquo; bearing the committees
of the Corporation and the officers of the
Governor&rsquo;s Guard. Alderman Cowdrey
made an address to which Clinton replied.
At nine o&rsquo;clock the fleet from Albany accompanied
by a fleet bearing the Corporation
set out for open sea. The spectacle
was one to attract much attention. Salutes
were fired from the Battery, from the forts
on Governor&rsquo;s Island, and from Forts
Lafayette and Tompkins. The destination
of the pageant was indicated by the U. S.
schooner &ldquo;Porpoise&rdquo; which preceded the
other craft and moored within the Hook,
where the interesting ceremony of wedding
the waters of the Atlantic and the
Great Lakes was to be held. &ldquo;... Never
before,&rdquo; wrote an enraptured beholder,
&ldquo;was there such a fleet collected,
and so superbly decorated; and it is very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
possible that a display so grand, so beautiful,
and we may even add, sublime, will
never again be witnessed. We know of
nothing with which it can be compared....
The orb of day darted
his genial rays upon the bosom of the
waters, where they played as tranquilly as
upon the natural mirror of a secluded lake.
Indeed the elements seemed to repose, as
if to gaze upon each other, and participate
in the beauty and grandeur of the sublime
spectacle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> At the auspicious moment
the Governor of New York permitted the
water from Lake Erie to fall into the ocean,
saying: &ldquo;This solemnity, at this place, on
the first arrival of vessels from Lake Erie,
is intended to indicate and commemorate
the navigable communication, which has
been accomplished between our Mediterranean
Seas and the Atlantic Ocean, in
about eight years, to the extent of more
than four hundred and twenty-five miles,
by the wisdom, public spirit, and energy of
the people of the state of New York; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
may the God of the Heavens and the Earth
smile most propitiously on this work, and
render it subservient to the best interests
of the human race.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Whereupon the
&ldquo;Young Lion of the West&rdquo; gave a brave
salute from &ldquo;a pair of brazen lungs&rdquo;
which he had provided for himself at
Rochester, and a collation was served on
the fleet.</p>

<p>While these inspiriting scenes were
being enacted, the greatest procession, it
was said, that ever had been formed in
America to date, was preparing in the city
under the direction of Major-general Fleming;
all classes were represented, the military
and civil societies, educational institutions,
the city departments, state artillery
and benevolent and mechanical organizations,
the whole enlivened by the playing
of many bands. At 10:30 o&rsquo;clock the line,
one mile and a half in length, began its
march. From Greenwich Street, the route
was through Canal to Broadway, up Broadway
to Broome, up Broome to the Bowery,
down the Bowery to Pearl, down Pearl to
the Battery, and thence to Broadway and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the City Hall. At night the illuminations
were beautiful, the commonest being the
letter &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grand Canal;&rdquo; the New
York Coffee House, the City Hotel, Peale&rsquo;s
Museum, Scudder&rsquo;s Museum, Chatham and
Park theaters had elaborate displays. The
illuminations of the City Hall were &ldquo;surpassingly
beautiful.&rdquo; The exhibition of
fireworks in New York was said to be the
greatest in its history. On Monday evening,
November 7, the celebration was concluded
by a grand ball at the Lafayette
Amphitheatre in Laurens Street; in order
to secure the necessary space required, the
floor of the amphitheater was connected
with the floors of an adjacent circus building
on one side and the floor of a riding
school on the other; as a result the
largest ball room in America was temporarily
formed, measuring two hundred feet
in length and from sixty to one hundred
feet in width. Above the proscenium were
emblazoned the names of the engineers of
the &ldquo;Grand Canal&rdquo;&mdash;Briggs, White,
Geddes, Wright, and Thomas; also the
names of the past and present canal commissioners&mdash;Hart,
Bouck, Holly, De Witt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Livingston, Fulton, Clinton, Van Rensselaer,
Morris, Eddy, Young, Seymour, Porter,
and Ellicott. In the ladies&rsquo; banquet
room a boat made of maple sugar&mdash;the
gift of Colonel Hinman of Utica to Governor
Clinton&mdash;floated proudly on Lake Erie
water.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the great celebration
the committee from the West departed
for Lake Erie, carrying with them a keg of
Atlantic water, ornamented with the arms
of the city of New York and the following
words in letters of gold: &ldquo;Neptune&rsquo;s return
to Pan. New York, 4th Nov. 1825. Water
of the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the last scene in this old pageant
was enacted at Buffalo on November 23; at
ten o&rsquo;clock of the morning of that day the
committee, accompanied by a band, were
towed out into the basin of Lake Erie; the
waters of the Atlantic were poured into the
lake, Judge Wilkinson delivering an appropriate
address. In the evening a concluding
celebration was held at the Eagle
Tavern. The waters of the ocean and the
Great Lakes were at last united; how
largely the celebration was inspired by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
political interests it is impossible to say.
The fact remains that the pageant was one
of the most significant in American history
and marked a new era in the commercial
awakening of America.</p>

<h3>LOCAL INFLUENCES OF THE CANAL</h3>


<p>A careful study of the influence of
the Erie Canal upon the great commonwealth
which built it has been
made by Mr. Julius Winden, and the results
of his investigation, important and interesting,
have been placed at the disposal of
the present writer.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The entire region
affected by the canal, from New York City
to Buffalo, is divided by Mr. Winden into
three sections; the first covers the Hudson
River valley from the mouth of the Mohawk
to the sea; the second includes the
Mohawk Valley from the Hudson to Utica
where the canal left the valley; the third
extends from the Mohawk to Lake Erie.
The sections are designated, respectively,
as Section A, Section B, and Section C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Again, each section is divided into three
classes; Class I includes the land within
six miles of the canal route; Class II includes
all land between six and twelve
miles from the canal route; Class III includes
all land within the counties tapped
by the canal lying at a greater distance
than twelve miles from its course. Mr.
Winden first discusses the effect of the
canal on the population of the counties
through which it ran, and thus summarizes
his results:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the three sections considered, we
have found one, Section A, with a certain
condition of the population due to the influence
of an old waterway, the Hudson
river. Population was concentrated along
the banks of the river and decreased as the
distance from the river increased. The extension
of this waterway into new and
broader fields resulted in a very great increase
of the concentration of population
on the banks of the stream, but had little
or no influence on the population at a
distance of six or more miles from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second region, Section B, presented
conditions very similar to the one preced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>ing.
It was influenced by an old waterway,
the Mohawk River, but this waterway was
not very serviceable. The population was
concentrated along the course of the waterway,
but not as markedly as in Section A.
An increase in the serviceability of the
waterway and an extension into new fields
had the effect of concentrating the population
along the course of the waterway much
greater than in Section A. The region six
or more miles from the waterway was little
affected or none at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the third region, Section C, we
found a new region, having no waterway
and having less population per square mile
where a waterway was to be made than the
region a short distance from the future
course of the waterway. The effect of the
waterway was to increase the population
very rapidly along its course and produce
a great concentration of population there.
In the remote region the population was
also greatly increased. We also notice that
this concentration of population in Class I
along this watercourse tended to mass into
cities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The per capita valuation of property<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
next engages attention and the result is
thus outlined:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As before mentioned Section A was an
old well-settled region during this period,
and although property had a tendency to
mass along the banks of the Hudson and
gradually to diminish as the distance from
the river increased, still this increase of the
valuation of property advanced much more
slowly than the increase in population.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Section B was an old and well settled
region, but it was not as old as Section A.
Here valuation massed along the canal
but it did not increase as rapidly as the
population, still it increased more rapidly
in proportion to the increase of population
than did Section A.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Section C was a new region where the
increase in valuation kept pace with the
increasing population and even exceeded it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A re-invigoration of an old region by
increased commercial advantages such as
the Erie canal provided for in Sections A
and B results in an increase of property
within about six miles of that commercial
route, but it has little effect outside of that
limit. This increase of property, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
does not keep pace with the increase in
population, <i>i.e.</i> property in this case is
more stable and unchangeable than population.
On the other hand, in a new region
never having felt the influence of a commercial
route such as the Erie Canal, property
within about six miles of the route
increases as rapidly and even more rapidly
than the population. This increase of
property is not confined within the six mile
limit, but extends much farther away from
the route than it does in an old well-settled
region having previously felt the influence
of a commercial route. Thus the extension
of a waterway into new fields is beneficial
to the region along the banks of the
old waterway, but affects the territory a
distance from the route little or none at all;
while a waterway extended into a new
region is of very great benefit to the region
immediately along the route and it is also
beneficial, to a less degree, to the remote
regions. It must be remembered that a
waterway is different from a railroad, in
that material can be shipped at almost any
point, while a railroad has certain stations
were material can be shipped; thus a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
waterway&rsquo;s influence is continuous along the
line, while the influence of the railroad is
at points where there are stations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the distribution of real and personal
property in 1835 very significant results are
shown. In Class I of Section A the real
property per capita was $150.22 and the
personal property was $49.11; in Class II
the real property was $195.96 and the
personal $34.34; in Class III the real
property was $166.49 and the personal was
$37.22. The least real property per capita
and the least personal property per capita
was in Class II, and Class III was second in
both. In Class I of Section B the real
property was $133.81 per capita and the
personal $49.71; in Class II the real property
was $108.92 and the personal $17.41;
in Class III the real property was $90.68
and the personal $13.34.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both real and personal property were
greatest in Class I, Class II was second in
both, and Class III was third in both.
Class I of Section C was first in both real
and personal property; Class II was second
and Class III was third in both real and
personal property. This section shows the
same relations that we find in Section B.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The location of the real and personal
property in the three sections considered
indicates very clearly that the personal
property was massed along the waterway;
in Class I and as the distance increased
from the waterway the personal property
diminished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the improvement of land Mr. Winden
remarks:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be stated that there was a slight
tendency for the improvement of land to
increase concomitantly with the increase in
population; but the topography of the
country and other elements entered in to
such an extent as to nearly destroy this
parallel growth. The improvement of land
is much more stable and less likely to sudden
and great changes than is the population.
For this reason we would not expect
to find as large a per cent of improved
land in proportion to the population in
Section C as we would find in Section B,
nor as large a per cent in Section B as in
Section A; because Section A is the oldest
in settlement, and Section C the youngest.
The per cent of improved land as a whole
in the three sections supports this conclusion.
But in comparing the various classes
of each section with each other, however,
we do not always find the greater per cent
of improved land in the region of the most
concentrated population. In Section A, in
1820 and 1825, a larger per cent of land
was improved in Class II than in Class I,
while the population in Class I was much
greater than in Class II. In Section B in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
1835 Class II had a larger per cent of improved
land than Class I while the population
was nearly twice as great per square
mile in the latter as in the former. A
somewhat similar condition also existed
in Section C. In 1820 and 1825 both the
population and the per cent of improved
land were greater in Class II than in Class
I; in 1835 the per cent of improved land
was still greater in Class II but the population
was much less than in Class I. The
above conditions indicate that the population
and also the wealth increased with
such remarkable rapidity in Class I along
the entire watercourse independently of
the topographical conditions and in spite of
natural disadvantages. They also indicate
that the concentration of population in
Class I was much greater than the population
per square mile taken alone would
seem to indicate. This is especially true
of Class I in 1835.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The effect of the canal on live stock is
thus summed up:</p>

<p>&ldquo;During this entire period Classes II
and III raised more stock in proportion to
their population than did Class I. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
beginning of the period in 1820, Class II
in Sections A and B and Class III in Section
C raised the greatest number of horses.
Class III in Sections B and C and Class II
in Section A raised the greatest number of
cattle; Class III of Sections A and C and
Class II of Section B raised the greatest
number of sheep. At the close of the
period in 1835, Class II in all three sections
raised the greatest number of horses, Class
III in Sections A and C and Class II in
Section B raised the greatest number of
cattle. Class III in all the sections raised
the greatest number of sheep. It is thus
clearly seen that the area of the least concentration
of population was the region in
which stock-raising was most extensively
carried on. By this it is not meant that
there is a smaller amount of stock raised
in a given area, where the population is
dense than in a sparsely settled region, but
that there is a smaller proportion raised to
the population.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winden&rsquo;s summary in connection
with the study of aliens and foreigners is
most interesting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is thus clearly seen that if New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
State received her just share of all the
classes of emigrants arriving in the United
States during this period, she would have
added to her population, a strong, useful
and able-bodied class of men who would
aid her greatly in her development.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why this region of concentrated population,
the towns along the Erie canal,
should contain such a large part of the
foreign element is probably due to numerous
causes. This was a region of great
activity and growth; a place where there
was room for unskilled as well as skilled
labor of all kinds; it was along a direct
route of transportation and travel to the
great and growing west and a foreigner
knowing nothing about the country and
having no definite destination would stop
along the route wherever he could make a
living. Although chance may have largely
determined the location of the foreigners
in this new country, his old environment
was also an important factor in determining
his place of settlement. He came from an
old and well settled region in Europe
where the population was concentrated and
the country often overcrowded and in com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>ing
to America he would tend to seek a
region of somewhat similar characteristics.
He found these conditions with the exception
of an overcrowded population in the
densely settled country immediately along
the Erie canal and the Hudson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In turning to the New Englander in
New York we find a people of an entirely
different education and character from that
of the foreigner. This is seen most strikingly
in the choice of their location. They
were shrewd, frugal, and hardworking
farmers who left their New England homes
because they failed to supply their wants.
In seeking a new home in the west they
naturally followed their old occupation and
for this reason we find the larger part of
them in the rural region. In Class I of
Section A, 4.1% was of New England birth;
in Class II 2.7%, and in Class III, 5.2%;
in Class I of Section B, 5.7%, in Class II,
9.7%, and in Class III, 10.1%; in Class I
of Section C, 10.1%, in Class II, 10.3% and
in Class III, 11.7%. The New Englander
also tended to shun the large cities. In
Albany 5.1% was of New England birth,
and in Utica 7.8%, while in Class I of Sec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>tion
B, in which these two cities were situated,
5.7% was of New England birth. In
Buffalo 9.3% was of this origin and in
Rochester 9.6% while in Class I of Section
C 10.1% originated in New England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The preceding discussion leads us to
the conclusion that the foreigner was
massed in the region of concentrated population
and especially in the cities, and as
the concentration of population diminished,
the per cent of foreigners decreased. In
other words, along the Erie Canal lay the
larger part of the foreign population. Of
this foreign population in New York State,
the larger per cent was born in Great
Britain and her dependencies, and this
class was chiefly found where the population
was thickest. The New Englander
constituted a larger part of those born in
other states of the Union and they were
found chiefly in the rural regions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his study of politics as presented in
the territory traversed by the Erie Canal
Mr. Winden raises most interesting questions.
We quote him in full, appending
his notes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turning now to the political aspect in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
New York State during this period we find
a complicated problem. In the election of
1830 there were two important parties.
Summing up the principles for which these
two important political parties of New
York stood in this election, we find that
the Anti-Masonic or National Republican
party opposed the Masonic order;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> supported
Clay&rsquo;s American policy of protection
and the extension of the internal improvement
system;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> catered to the workingmen<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
and opposed the administration
of both the national and state government.
In other words it was like all new parties,
gathering to its fold all the radical elements
by adopting some of their ideas.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In the
campaign which followed they made an
aggressive canvass, making the most of the
Morgan outrage. The Republican, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Masonic party, as it was called by the Anti-Masons,
tried to be indifferent to the
Masonic order and disavowed all support
of it;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> opposed the American system and
did not advocate an extensive local improvement
system<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and supported the
national and state administrations. They
conducted a defensive campaign against
the accusations of the Anti-Masons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before considering the vote of the election
it is necessary to take a hasty view of
the social and economic conditions of the
state at that time. Morgan had disappeared
in western New York four years
before and this had caused a great local
opposition to the Masons which had spread
throughout the state and even into neighboring
states. The internal improvement
movement had assumed stupendous proportions;
the state had completed four
canals within the last seven years; the
Champlain in 1823, the Erie in 1825, the
Oswego in 1828, and the Cayuga and Seneca
in 1829. And the people were clamoring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
for more. Just after the completion of
the Erie canal in 1825, petitions for other
canals had poured in from almost every
county in the west.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Thus it can be safely
said that the entire western part of the
state was in favor of internal improvements
at public expense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now considering the vote, we find that
Section A gave a large majority to Mr.
Throop, the Republican candidate. In
Section B he also received a majority but
not as great as in Section A. In this section
an important fact is noticeable, Classes
II and III gave a smaller majority to Mr.
Throop than Class I. These two classes
having no canals thus expressed their
desire for some means of communication.
Section C cast a large majority in favor of
Mr. Granger, the National Republican candidate.
The result in Section C was just
what we should expect. Class III of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
section which was in most need of some
means of communication voted a much
larger majority in favor of Mr. Granger
than Classes I and II. The cities, however,
gave a majority to Mr. Throop, Utica casting
a larger and Albany a smaller majority
than the class in which they are situated.
Buffalo also cast a majority in favor of Mr.
Throop, although the class in which it is
situated cast a majority in favor of Mr.
Granger. (See table.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus it is clearly shown that the people
largely voted for the respective candidates
because they stood for economic
principles which were of direct interest to
them.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The most densely populated east

the Republican candidate, was elected by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
a vote of 128,842. Mr. Granger received
120,361 votes, mostly from the west and
rural regions which were demanding internal
improvements, while Mr. Williams, the
candidate of the dissatisfied Working
Men&rsquo;s party, received 2,332 votes.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>&ldquo;In the presidential election of 1840,
strictly economic principles were not prominent.
The Whig National convention met
at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, December 4,
1839, and nominated William H. Harrison
of Ohio and John Tyler of Virginia for
President and Vice-president respectively.
They conducted the campaign with unbounded
enthusiasm, attacking Van Buren
and his financial policy with great energy.
Although they adopted no platform, they
favored loose construction, the American
system of protective tariff, and internal
improvement by the national government.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Democratic national convention
met at Baltimore, May 5, 1840, and adopted
a strict constructionist platform, denying
the power of Congress to carry on internal
improvements,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to protect manufactures,
to charter a National Bank, or to interfere
with slavery in the states. It unanimously
renominated President Van Buren, but left
nominations for the Vice-presidency to be
made by the various states. The simulta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>neous
appearance of the &lsquo;Panic of 1837&rsquo;
and Van Buren in the presidential chair
produced the belief in the popular mind
that he was the cause of that unfortunate
financial distress. The vote in New York
is likely to indicate the two following facts:
where the financial distress was greatest
and the region most favorable to internal
improvements. Van Buren carried Section
A, with the largest majority in Class III.
Recalling that this was a rural region, very
stable in its population and valuation, we
see that it would be least affected by financial
distress. Classes I and II of Section
B were also carried by Van Buren, but the
rural region, Class III, was carried by Harrison.
Section C was also carried by Harrison,
with the largest majority in Class
III. The large cities also gave a majority
to Harrison and although Albany and Utica
are situated in a class which cast a larger
vote for Van Buren they gave a majority
to Harrison; and even Buffalo gave a
greater per cent of its vote to Harrison
than the class in which it is situated. The
large majority in Class III of Section C
may be accounted for by the enthusiasm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
for internal improvements in this region
and the majority in the cities by their
opposition to Van Buren because of the
great distress they were subject to during
the Panic of 1837.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We find the state issues and results of
the election somewhat similar to those of
the national election in the state. The
Whigs nominated Governor W. H. Seward
and the Democrats nominated Mr. Bouck.
The Whigs advocated internal improvements
upon a large scale, while the Democrats
advocated retrenchment in this work.
The Albany <i>Argus</i> of September 25, 1840,
states of Mr. Seward, the Whig nominee
for governor: Departing from the democratic
policy of enlarging the Erie canal
by means of its revenues only, he has
urged upon the legislature, its &lsquo;more
speedy&rsquo; enlargement, at all hazards, and
the creation of a debt for that purpose&mdash;a
debt which alone will absorb all our
revenues, leaving the principal to be paid
by direct taxation. He has recommended
that state work be undertaken, the cost of
which will involve the people in debt of at
least $40,000,000. In addition he has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
urged upon the legislature loans to corporations&mdash;of
the credit of the state to an
indefinite amount&mdash;for almost every mad
scheme speculators might suggest.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Summing up the most important internal
improvement works for which Mr.
Seward advocated state aid, we have, the
enlargement of the Erie canal,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the Black
River canal in the counties of Oneida and
Lewis and joining the Black River with the
Erie canal, the Genesee Valley canal in the
counties of Broome, Chenango, Madison,
and Oneida joining the Chenango river
with the Erie Canal (the two canals last
mentioned would unite Lake Ontario with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the Susquehanna River), and the Hudson
and Erie Railroad previously mentioned.
Turning to the results of the election we
find that Section A gave a large majority
to Mr. Bouck with the greatest per cent of
the vote in Class I, and the least in Class
III; Classes I and II of Section B also cast
a majority for Mr. Bouck, but Class III
and all of Section C gave a majority to Mr.
Seward. Class III of the last mentioned
section gave the largest per cent and Class
II the next to the largest per cent of the
vote to Mr. Seward. Recalling that the
Hudson and Erie railroad was to pass
through the entire length of the southern
part of Class III of Section C and also
through Class III of Section A, we see the
cause of the increased vote above the
neighboring classes for Mr. Seward. (See
Table.) The conclusion to be drawn from
the above fact that the rural region which
was most desirous of obtaining some means
of communication had cast the larger per
cent for Mr. Seward who supported an extensive
system of internal improvement,
is that economic conditions largely determined
the vote.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In conclusion it may be stated that the
Erie Canal was a great stimulus to the
growth of population and the increase in
valuation of property along the entire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
waterway of the Hudson and Erie Canal.
The greatest activity, however, was felt
west of the head waters of the Mohawk
along the canal proper. This concentration
of population tended to turn the attention
of the people away from rural pursuits
and resulted in their congregation in cities
where they developed a commercial life.
Along this line of dense population the immigrating
foreign element gathered in large
numbers while the New England settlers
confined themselves to the rural regions.
The political effect of the canal was to produce
a great enthusiasm for internal improvements
which was the main political
issue in the state during the following
years. The western part of the state and
rural regions at a distance from the canal
clamored for further improvements which
would benefit them, and accordingly cast a
majority of their votes for the candidates
who stood for an extensive internal improvement
system while the east opposed
them. It should also be mentioned that in
each section with the exception of Section
A in the election of 1830 and the presidential
election of 1840, the region with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
largest number of foreigners cast a greater
per cent of its vote for the conservative
candidate than the region containing the
greatest number of New Englanders. Thus
it is clearly seen that political life is largely
influenced by economic conditions and the
character of the people.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE CANAL FUND AND ENLARGEMENTS</h3>


<p>No more important question was proposed
to the commissioners in 1816
than the one which asked them to
ascertain where the money that was to
build the Erie Canal was coming from.
Of course a loan must be made and the
commissioners at once began casting about
for information. William Bayard inquired
for loans in Europe, but no answer was now
at hand. &ldquo;The Committee entertain no
doubt,&rdquo; was the tentative reply in 1817,
&ldquo;but that as much money can be obtained
in this country, as may be required for the
canal, on the credit of the state, at an interest
of 6 per cent by the creation of a funded
debt, and that ample funds may be appropriated
for the payment of the interest, and
the gradual extinguishment of the debt
without the imposition of taxes.&rdquo; The commissioners
applied to those states which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
it seemed, would be most benefited by the
canal, Vermont on one side and Ohio and
Kentucky (!) on the other, and to the United
States. &ldquo;But if no extraneous aid should
be afforded,&rdquo; the commissioners concluded
with threatening menace, &ldquo;it will at all
times be in the power of this state to levy
high transit on the articles transported to
and from those states and the territory of
the United States, and thereby secure
eventually, a greater fund than can possibly
arise from any present contribution
from those quarters.&rdquo; In order to facilitate
gifts in lands or money, the commissioners
scattered blank forms of cession
and bequest throughout the country; &ldquo;one
form relates to gratuitous grants of land
for the ground through which the canal is
to pass, and the other is a contribution to
the fund for making it. Agents have also
been appointed in Vermont and Ohio for
the same purpose.&rdquo; It was reported that
nearly all the land necessary for the canal
throughout its entire length would be ceded
by the owners to the state for the purpose.
In concluding their report for the year
ending February 15, 1817, the commission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>ers
affirmed that &ldquo;their investigations have
shown the physical facility of this great
internal communication, and a little attention
to the resources of the state will
demonstrate its financial practicability.
And they may be permitted to remark, that
unless it is established the greater part of
the trade which does not descend the Mississippi,
from all those vast and fertile
regions west of the Seneca lake, will be
lost to the United States.&rdquo; This report
is signed by De Witt Clinton, S. Van
Rensselaer, Samuel Young, and Myron
Holley.</p>

<p>The needs of the canal were of course
outlined in the estimates of expense of
building; the estimated cost of the Western
Section, according to James Geddes, was
$1,801,862; that of the Middle Section, by
Benjamin Wright&rsquo;s figures, was $853,186,
and that of the Eastern Section, Charles C.
Broadhead estimated at $2,271,690. The
total amounted to $4,926,538 or five millions
in round numbers. The committee
of the legislature advised the organization
of the Board of Commissioners of a Canal
Fund, to borrow $1,500,000 at six per cent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
interest. The annual revenue of the canal
was estimated at $924,000 and the expenditure
$547,000.</p>

<p>William Ford, chairman of the joint
committee of the legislature, addressed De
Witt Clinton on March 8, 1817, asking him
to outline a financial system for a canal
fund. Clinton&rsquo;s scheme, which became the
basis of all New York&rsquo;s canal building, is
thus sketched by Mr. Sweet:<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;1. Borrow $1,500,000 on the credit of
the State, by the creation of a funded debt,
with interest at six per cent, principal
reimbursable in twenty years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2. The said Committee shall keep an
account of all moneys received for the said
fund, (which moneys shall be kept in the
treasury), and shall pay over, from time to
time, such moneys as shall be required for
the execution of the powers committed to
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3. The said Committee of the fund
shall, as soon as the whole or a part of the
said works be completed, have power to
establish and receive reasonable tolls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;4. The annual application of $60,000
of the moneys arising which the State may
derive from the sale of unappropriated
lands, shall be pledged for the payment of
said debt and the interest thereof. And
they shall have power to apply any unappropriated
money in the treasury to make
good any deficiency or suspension in the
payment of said funds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;5. The said Committee shall, at the
opening of the next session of the Legislature,
report a plan of finances for the
execution of the whole of said canals, and
also of a sinking fund for the extinguishment
of the debt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this same communication it was
stated that 400,000 tons of freight were
carried annually on the Hudson River.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus De Witt Clinton laid the foundation
of our canal financial system. He
estimated that ten million tons annually
would be carried upon the canals; that the
cost of a ton for transportation from Buffalo
to Albany would be $3.00.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The expenses of the engineering department
to April 2, 1817, had been $14,462,
and the total for exploration and surveying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
$42,957. The act to provide funds for the
canal and also funds for the redemption of
the funded debt of the state was passed
April 21, 1818. This law authorized the
comptroller to sell certain three per cent
United States bonds, and to apply the
proceeds to the redemption of the funded
debt; the comptroller was ordered to borrow
one million dollars at six per cent
after advertising for proposals for the same.
The governor was empowered to appoint a
cashier of a New York bank to issue certificates
of stock, the principal to be redeemable
until 1823, taxed at one mill on
the dollar; state deposits were to be made
in any bank in New York that would loan
one million dollars. The act of March,
1819, authorized the borrowing of $700,000
yearly for the building of the canal; on
March 25 this was reduced to $600,000; an
assessment of a tax upon all lands within
twenty-five miles of the canal, formerly
made, was at this time suspended. By a
law of April 7, 1819, the commissioners
were again authorized to borrow a sum not
exceeding (together with the net income
of the canal fund) $600,000. The board of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
commissioners of the canal fund was now
reduced to three members (January 20,
1820) at a salary of $2,500 each. To meet
the extraordinary expenses of 1819, as
previously detailed, the commissioners
were empowered, April 12, 1820, to borrow
$122,500 at six per cent interest;
three fourths of this was to be equally divided
between the Eastern and Western
sections; the remainder was for the Champlain
Canal. The first tolls were levied
on the Erie Canal July, 1820; in that year
$5,244 was collected, $450 of it from the
old canal of the Western Inland Lock Navigation
Company at Little Falls.</p>

<p>By a concurrent resolution in the legislature,
the comptroller, A. McIntyre, was
allowed to put into execution a plan for a
sinking fund for the extinguishing of the
canal debt, January 12, 1821. He took, as
a basis of his calculation, a debt of $5,905,456
and a revenue of $210,000; the loan of
$600,000, with revenues, was to be continued
as heretofore. By this plan the debt
was to be extinguished in 1842, at which
time the revenue, it was estimated, would
be about $580,000, and the canal tolls,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
$150,000 beyond expenditures for repairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If these estimates of revenue and of
the expense of making the canals, be correct,
it results that the canals will be completed
in 1830, and that the canal loans
will be discharged in 1843.&rdquo; An act dated
February 9, 1821, authorized the commissioners
to borrow one million dollars in
both 1821 and 1822. Nothing can be more
interesting than the financial estimates, the
fears and doubts and the staunch firmness
of these directors of the Erie Canal. In
almost every case the estimates of expenses
fell far below the actual cost; often the
expenses ran thirty per cent above estimates;
on the other hand the most optimistic
commissioner never, in his most
enthusiastic moment, realized what a tremendous
income was to be received from
the Erie Canal when it should be completed.
Far as expenses ran ahead of estimates,
they never exceeded them so far as
the actual income of the canal exceeded
the estimated income. This cannot be
more clearly indicated than by a table
showing estimated tolls and those actually
received, from 1826 to 1834:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>In only these eight years, it will be seen,
the receipts exceeded the estimates by
nearly two and one-quarter millions. In
many places these estimates had been
laughed to scorn. It will be difficult to
find in all the commercial history of
America a more splendid success, and it
will be quite as difficult to find an instance
where success was more richly deserved.</p>

<p>Between June, 1817, and October, 1821,
the sum of $2,893,500 was borrowed for
canal work, the lenders advancing $91,202
in premiums; the yearly interest was
$159,580. The tolls of 1821 amounted to
$23,000. It will be interesting to notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
on what these tolls were levied; the list
includes 44,723 barrels of flour, 17,068
barrels of salt, 43,078 bushels of wheat,
1,061,844 feet of lumber, 71,000 bushels of
lime, 9,993 pounds of maple sugar, 85 tons
of butter and lard, 772 tons of gypsum,
2,500 tons of merchandise, 47 wagons, and
10 coaches. The rates of toll per mile in
1821 were as follows:</p>

<p>The large amounts handled by the canal
commissioners during the building of the
canal will indicate the great responsibility
that lay on their shoulders; between
1817 and 1822 the amount paid out by
Myron Holley was $1,799,425.58; by
H. Seymour, $833,335.70; by S. Young,
$554,641.19.</p>

<p>By a law passed March 29, 1823, the commissioners
were authorized to borrow
$1,300,000 and also $120,000 to pay interest
on the canal bonds. The tolls collected
the year before amounted to $60,446.89; in
this year they ran up to $125,991.76;
$77,593.26 was collected between the
Seneca and Utica, and $27,444.09 between
Little Falls and Albany. On April 12,
1824, the commissioners were authorized to
borrow one million dollars to complete the
canals. In this year ten thousand boats
passed the junction of the Erie and Champlain
canals; 157,446 tons of freight were
handled and $294,546.62 was received from
tolls. The following table will show the
exact number of miles that was completed
in the years from 1820 to 1824 and the tolls
received from the canal alone:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>The debt incurred, including the amount
required for completion and payment of
all claims at the close of the year 1824, was
$7,700,000.</p>

<p>This estimate proved approximately
correct, the total cost being $19,255.49 per
mile, a trifle over one-half of the cost per
mile of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.</p>

<p>The success of the Erie Canal, shown
by the tolls received from 1825 to 1834
($8,539,377.70), was more than its promoters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
had expected; indeed it was so great that
the enlargement of the canal was rendered
imperative within a decade. This
was first urged by the citizens of one of
the jewel-cities made by the great waterway&mdash;Utica.
The memorial now reported
to the legislature by E. F. Johnson called
for a steamboat canal from Utica to Oswego
(Lake Ontario) which was to be extended
to Albany; the proposed depth was eight
feet, width fifty-eight feet on the bottom
and ninety feet on the surface, the locks
one hundred and thirty feet long by thirty
feet wide. &ldquo;On the Erie Canal,&rdquo; the
memorial urged, &ldquo;the cost of animal
power is 12 per cent greater than steam
power on the Hudson for flour, and 42 per
cent greater for merchandize; agricultural
products, including ashes, 21 per cent
greater on the canal than on the Hudson
river. The Erie canal is small, and the
traction of boats that navigate it is from 30
to 45, and most usually 40 per cent greater
than would occur on a canal of the most
favorable size for the boat used....
That a canal boat, 104 feet long, 16 feet
wide, drawing 7 feet water, would carry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
200 tons, and require a lock 115 feet long
by 17 feet wide; the sectional area of boat
below load water line 108 feet. The gross
load of a schooner, with its own weight,
would be 350 tons. Canal boats, constructed
with reference to freight merely,
will generally weigh in the ratio of their
cargo as 4 to 9.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Engineer N. S. Roberts
in a report dated January 17, 1835, said:
&ldquo;The present canal admits boats 13&frac12; feet
wide, 3 feet draught, 80 feet long, displaces
80 tons water, weight of boat 30 to
35 tons, cargo 45 tons. Size of canal, 28
[26?] feet bottom, 40 feet surface, 4 feet
depth cross sec[tion] = 136 [132?] sq. feet.
Enlarged canal to reduce cost of transportation,
43&frac34; per cent must be 33 feet bottom,
48 feet top, and 5 feet deep, cross
sec[tion]: 202.5; width and size of locks:
15&times;110 between gates, admitting a boat
102 feet long, 13&frac12; feet wide, and 4 feet
draught.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>After examination, the canal board determined
to make the canal seventy feet
wide on the surface, seven feet deep; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
locks were to measure 110 feet between
quoins and be eighteen feet deep. It was
estimated that a canal of these proportions
would save fifty per cent of transportation
charges exclusive of tolls.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The enlargement
construction law was passed May 11,
1835; the act called for the construction of
&ldquo;double locks thereon as soon as they
should deem it for the public interest; the
dimensions of the canals and locks to be
fixed by the Canal Board.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The new canal, seventy feet wide by
seven feet deep, was divided into four sections.
The first was from Albany to the
eastern end of the Rome summit; the estimated
cost of this section for enlargement
was $2,864,335.96. The second section ran
from east end of Rome summit to Jordan;
estimated cost, $1,194,804.74. The third
lay between Jordan and Rochester; estimated
cost $2,739,139.51. The portion
from Rochester to Buffalo comprised the
fourth section, its estimated cost being
$4,518,575.85. The total estimated cost,
after adding ten per cent for contingencies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
was $12,448,856.06.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Twenty-one double
and three single locks were planned between
Albany and Schenectady; one double
and three single at Little Falls; two
double and one single at Syracuse; one
single lock at Lyons; two single at Lockville;
one double and one single at Macedon.
On January 1, 1838, these were all
under contract, at a contract price of
$3,035,087.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> One year later contracts to
the amount of ten and one-half millions for
the whole work of enlargement had been
signed. The commissioners were authorized
by an act passed April 18, 1839, to
borrow four millions.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The work went on
rapidly. By April 1, 1842, the Rochester
aqueduct was completed, at a cost of half a
million; the north tier of the locks at
Lockport was in use in April of the next
year. The total cost of the works here
was $610,978. In 1845 twenty-nine out of
forty-nine double set of locks between
Albany and Syracuse were completed and
ninety-eight miles of the new enlarged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
canal was open for use; the cost for this
portion was $3,685,438. The total cost of
enlargement contracted for prior to April
1, 1842, was $9,361,442. By 1850 the cost
had run up to fifteen millions, which was
distributed by years as follows:</p>

<p>This enlargement was completed in 1862
and is legally known as the &ldquo;enlargement
of 1862.&rdquo; When completed the canal was
350&frac12; miles long; it had seventy-two locks,
measuring 110&times;18 feet, of which fifty-seven
were double and fifteen single. The
building of double locks did not cease
until 1875.</p>

<p>Further enlargement of the Erie Canal
has been almost constantly under discussion.
In 1863 State Engineer Taylor suggested
gunboat locks twenty-six feet wide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and two hundred and twenty-five feet long,
with a depth of seven feet. What was
known as the &ldquo;Seymour Plan&rdquo; was
brought forward by State Engineer Seymour
in 1878, which called for a deepening
of the canal to eight feet by lowering
the bottom in some places and raising the
banks in others. State Engineer Sweet
proposed a ship canal across New York,
eighteen feet in depth, in 1884. In 1892
the subject of enlarging the canal was considered
by Congress,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> but nothing was
done until 1895 when the &ldquo;Nine Million&rdquo;
act was passed by the New York legislature,
granting about half the sum asked
for by the state engineer for improvement.</p>

<p>The work was begun in 1897 and consisted
of deepening the canal to nine feet
in the waterway and eight feet over structures.
The work went on through 1898
when the appropriation gave out and it was
suspended.</p>

<p>But before the passage of this act an
effort was being made to secure recognition
at Albany in order that the subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of enlargement might be more thoroughly
studied before the state should be committed
to any policy; and even after the
general assembly had voted for the expenditure
of nine millions of dollars, yet the
men behind the scenes were not dismayed,
but with greater determination their work
was carried on.</p>

<p>The story of initiative work, of the
arousing of public sentiment, the obtaining
of recognition of those in power at Albany,
the years of work expended and of thousands
of dollars obtained by voluntary
subscription for the carrying on of the
work can never be told in detail and could
only be told by such men as Mr. George
H. Raymond of Buffalo and his associates.
But that their work was efficient time has
already proved.</p>

<p>The first official recognition of the necessity
for radical enlargement or total abandonment
(this latter being a natural deduction
from the former) was the passage of
an act by the general assembly of the
state<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> authorizing the governor to appoint
a commission &ldquo;to examine into the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>merce
of New York, the cause of its decline
and the means for its revival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Governor Black appointed Charles A.
Schieren, Andrew H. Green, C. C. Shayne,
Hugh Kelly, and Alexander R. Smith to
constitute what was officially known as the
New York Commerce Commission but was
usually called the &ldquo;Black Commission.&rdquo;
This body of men submitted a preliminary
report to the legislature of 1899<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and continued
its investigations under authority
of an amendment<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> making, in 1900, a
most exhaustive report thereon.</p>

<p>Long before the final report of the
&ldquo;Black Commission&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> was submitted
Theodore Roosevelt was governor and
taking active steps to assist in the solution
of the &ldquo;canal question.&rdquo; A &ldquo;Committee
on Canals of the State of New York&rdquo; was
appointed. The following quotations from
Governor Roosevelt&rsquo;s letter of appointment
written to Francis V. Greene on March 8,
1899, are self-explanatory:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very desirous of seeing the canal
policy of the state definitely formulated.
As you know, the nine million dollars
designated to deepen the canal to the depth
of nine feet has been practically expended,
and it is reported that sixteen millions
additional will be needed to carry this
scheme through, while at the same time,
certain experts have said that the scheme,
when carried through, will not be satisfactory....</p>

<p>&ldquo;I desire the opinion of a body of experts,
... I have decided to ask five
of the citizens of New York, whose reputation
in these respects stands highest, to
act with the Superintendent of Public
Works, Col. Partridge, and the State Engineer
and Surveyor, Mr. Bond, to make the
necessary investigations.... The
other four gentlemen will be Major T.
W. Symons, Hon. John N. Scatcherd,
Hon. George E. Green and Hon. Frank S.
Witherbee....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The broad question of the proper
policy which the State should pursue in
canal matters remains unsolved, and I ask
you to help me reach the proper solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>This committee submitted a report to
the governor, under date of January 15,
1900, stating &ldquo;That the canals connecting
the Hudson River with Lake Erie, Ontario
and Champlain should not be abandoned,
but should be maintained and enlarged.&rdquo;
The report contained many maps, documents
and tables, and offered convincing
arguments. The consideration of the two
reports, viz., the Black Commission and the
Roosevelt Committee, by the next general
assembly resulted in the passage of &ldquo;an
act directing the State Engineer and Surveyor
to cause surveys, plans and estimates
to be made for improving the Erie canal,
the Champlain canal, and the Oswego
canal and making an appropriation therefor.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The work thus authorized was carried
out and a report, comprising a thousand
pages of printed matter and thirty-four
plates in atlas form, was submitted to the
general assembly the following year.</p>

<p>One of the clearest statements of the
conditions which led New York to face the
great work of enlarging her canal is con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>tained
in a letter written to Governor Odell
by William F. King, President of the Merchants&rsquo;
Association of New York, as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to call your attention to what,
to my mind, is one of the most important
public improvements that can be made for
the benefit of the people of this State,
namely, the improvement of the Erie
Canal. It must not be forgotten that
formerly the minerals, the products of the
farm, the production of cotton, lumber,
coal; in fact, all raw materials, were
brought Eastward to be turned into manufactured
goods, and shipped West. Today
what are the conditions? The goods are
manufactured ready for market right in
the States where the raw material is found.
The consequence is that these self-same
States have grown so rapidly and so much
in wealth that it behooves our people to
realize the importance of the Erie Canal to
the manufacturing industries, and the
farming element of the State.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The widening and deepening of the
Erie Canal means continued prosperity to
the manufacturing industries of this State.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
It means that the raw material will come
to our different towns, villages, and cities
at an extremely low cost, and that we will
then be able to compete with the manufacturing
industries of the great Middle
West. Unless this is done, there is but
one alternative, that this great State lose
its commercial supremacy, which would
also mean a great loss in population. People
must be employed. If they cannot
secure work they will go to that market
where their services can be utilized at
good wages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The farmers of this State must remember
that conditions have changed in regard
to the products of the farm. Eastern
farmers cannot, because of natural conditions,
produce grain and meat products as
well as Western farmers can. Therefore,
Eastern farmers cannot profitably compete
in these products. They think that cheap
grain and provision freights from the West
to the seaboard give Western farm products
a still greater advantage, and therefore are
opposed to them. That may be true; but
will choking the Erie Canal, so that the
New York Central Railroad Company can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
maintain high local freight rates on manufactured
products and high-class traffic,
keep Western farm products from reaching
the seaboard as cheaply as now? We can
prevent Western grain and provisions from
passing across the State of New York, and
the present railroad policy is rapidly doing
it; but the only effect will be to send the
traffic through Canada and by rail routes
to Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Newport
News, Charleston, and especially New
Orleans and Galveston. That will greatly
harm this city, but what good will it do to
the New York State farmer?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The true market for a large part of
this State&rsquo;s farm products must be local
and the demand must come from the creation,
development, and prosperity of local
industries throughout the State, and these,
in turn, depend upon cheap freight rates
such as the Erie Canal will insure. Those
cheap rates will enable the important cities
of central New York to obtain iron ore,
and coal as cheaply as the lake ports and
the Pennsylvania towns now obtain those
raw materials, and will give the manufacturers
of those cities a considerable advan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>tage
in freight charges upon products intended
for export. Factories in the midst
of farms, with cheap freight outlets, is the
ideal condition for industrial prosperity.
This condition will reach its highest point
by development of the Erie Canal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the duty of the people of the
State to avail themselves of that which
nature has provided, the greatest waterway
in this country, if not in the world, the
Great Lakes. The connection of the Erie
Canal with the Hudson River also means a
connection with the East River and turns
Long Island Sound into an outlet of the
Erie Canal, by which freight from the
great West can be transported to the Eastern
States. With the Erie Canal improved,
New York would become the greatest harbor
in the world. It would bring about a
continuance of the enjoyment by this city
of the import trade of the nation. It would
also make New York the outlet for the export
trade of the United States with other
countries, making New York city not only
the greatest financial center, but also the
greatest commercial city. We have about
110 miles of water front available for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
shipping. This water front should be
made available for additional shipping, so
that the export trade could be increased,
making New York city the center for
export trade the same as Liverpool is in
England. This can only be done by the
improvement of the Erie Canal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for you, if you are re&euml;lected
Governor of the State, to advocate a
referendum to allow the people to vote for
the building of a 1,000-ton barge canal.
The party ignoring this issue is, to my
belief, doomed to defeat. The people
throughout the State are aroused to the
importance of the question. They are
determined to be allowed to vote on this
question.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption smcap">Map of the Erie Canal, Showing Improvements Proposed; from Report of February 12, 1901</span>
</div>

<p>The referendum was discussed, the necessary
laws passed, the project submitted to
the people and by a majority of nearly a
quarter of a million the state voted to
expend $101,000,000 for the rebuilding
of its canals with a prism 12 feet deep, 75
feet wide on the bottom, and 123 feet at
the surface of water, capable of floating
economically a barge of 10 feet draft of
1,000 tons capacity; with locks 328 feet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
long and 28 feet broad, capable of passing
two boats, 150 feet long, 25 feet wide and
10 feet draft.</p>

<p>Thus, in brief, was inaugurated the
largest work of its kind in our history, an
artificial waterway to connect an inland
lake and river, the entire expense to be
borne by a single state.</p>

<p>For the very boldness of its conception
and the magnitude of its realization it
demands our respect. As the old Erie Canal
heralded a new epoch in the commercial
history of America, is it not possible that
the new Grand Canal will be the beginning
of another new epoch in this new
century? A study of the map of the new
canal appended will show, for one thing,
that New York is going back to the old
idea of canalizing rivers. Instead of building
a canal beside the Mohawk, for instance,
her engineers will canalize that
river. This is in direct opposition to the
advice sent by Benjamin Franklin from
England to the Pennsylvania promoters of
inland navigation at the close of the Revolutionary
War;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> it is an indication of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>great advances in engineering science since
the days of Smeaton, and is made possible
by the substitution of the screw propeller
for the mule and tow-path. It is by this
means that the Ohio River is to be made a
great artery of commerce.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> With steamers
fitted out with low pressure engines it is
estimated that freight can be transported
profitably on the Ohio at an astonishingly
low rate with which no land method of
transportation can ever dare hope to compete.
The new project of New York,
therefore, brings back all the old-time
dreams of early American promoters&mdash;of
Washington&rsquo;s for the Potomac, of Morris&rsquo;s
for the Mohawk, and of Robert Morris&rsquo;s
for the Susquehanna. If modern engineering
can make the canalization of one river
a success, it can of hundreds of rivers. No
sooner was the Erie Canal a success in
1825 than Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland
and other states began canal building. No
sooner had New York voted in favor of
her thousand-ton barge canal than Ohio
again followed by passing an act looking
toward the improvement of her canal from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the Ohio to Lake Erie. Does New York
again lead the way to a new field of
national development by means of canalization
of rivers at the beginning of the
twentieth century, as she did by means of
canal-building at the beginning of the
nineteenth?</p>

same on the same report, and the amount
of the said damages and the expenses of
the said appraisal shall be audited by the
comptroller, and paid on his warrant by
the treasurer out of the canal fund; and
the people of this state shall thereupon be
invested with, and the said canal commissioners
may cause to be used, all the lands,
waters, streams, canals, locks, feeders, and
appurtenances aforesaid, for the purposes
intended by this act.</p>

upon salt hereby levied and imposed. And
further, that the said superintendent, instead
of a yearly report to the legislature,
shall make a quarter yearly report to the
commissioners of the canal fund, and pay
into the treasury of this state, on the first
Tuesday of February, May, August and
November, in each year, all the monies collected
by him during the quarter preceding
each of those days, deducting in addition
to what by law is now allowed to be deducted,
five per cent of the duties collected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
at all other salt works, not situated in the
county of Onondaga, and two per cent of
the duties upon Onondaga salt, as a compensation
for collecting and paying over
the same.</p>

<p>VII &nbsp; <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That it
shall be the duty of the said canal commissioners,
to raise the sum of two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, to be appropriated
towards the making and completing
of the said canals from the Mohawk
river to the Seneca river, and from Lake
Champlain to Hudson&rsquo;s river, by causing
to be assessed and levied in such manner
as the said commissioners may determine
and direct, the said sum of two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, upon the lands
and real estate, lying along the route of
the said canals, and within twenty-five
miles of the same, on each side thereof:
which sum so to be assessed and levied,
shall be assessed on the said lands and real
estate adjacent to the said several canals,
in such proportion for each, as the said
commissioners shall determine. And the
said commissioners shall have power to
make such rules and regulations, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
adopt such measures for the assessing,
levying, and collecting the sum or sums of
money, either by sale of the said lands or
otherwise, as they shall deem meet, and
the said assessment shall be made on said
lands, according to the benefit which they
shall be considered by the said commissioners,
as deriving from the making of
the said canals respectively: <i>Provided</i>,
That such rules, regulations and measures,
shall before they are carried into effect,
be sanctioned and approved by the chancellor
and judges of the supreme court,
or a majority of them: <i>And provided
further</i>, That if any company or individual
subject for such tax, shall subscribe any
money or other property towards the completion
of the said canals, the amount of
such donation or voluntary subscription,
shall, if the same is less than the amount
of the tax, be deducted therefrom, and if
more, he or they shall be entirely discharged
from the said tax.</p>

<p><i>And be it further enacted</i>, That from and
after the first day of May next, the aforesaid
tax upon steamboat passengers, shall
be demanded, taken and received, by each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
captain or master of every steamboat navigating
the Hudson river;<a name="FNanchor_768_75" id="FNanchor_768_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_75" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and that during
each month thereafter, in which such boat
shall be employed for the conveyance of
passengers, it shall be the duty of such
captain or master, to cause to be delivered
to the comptroller of this state, a return or
account, sworn to, before some officer
authorized to administer oaths, stating the
name of the boat, the number of trips made
by such boat during such month, and the
whole number of passengers conveyed on
board such boat, at each of the said trips,
over one hundred miles, and the number
conveyed less than one hundred miles, and
over thirty miles, and pay into the treasury
of this state the amount of such tax collected
during the time mentioned in the
said return, deducting three per cent thereof,
as a compensation for making such
return, and collecting and paying over the
said tax: <i>And further</i>, That in case of any
neglect or refusal in making such return,
or collecting and paying over the tax as
directed in and by this section, the captain
or master so neglecting, shall forfeit and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
pay the sum of five hundred dollars, besides
the amount of the tax so directed to be
collected and paid over, to be recovered in
an action of debt in the name of the people
of this state, and for the use of the aforesaid
fund.</p>

&ldquo;He [Hawley] was at Colonel Mynderse&rsquo;s office in
1805, attending to the shipment of some flour to market,
by the circuitous and uncertain route then in use. Himself
and Colonel Mynderse conversing upon the necessities
for better facilities, Mr. Hawley said: &lsquo;Why not
have a canal extend direct into our country, and benefit
all&mdash;merchants, millers, and farmers.&rsquo;&rdquo; Hawley then
pointed out on a map that Lake Erie could be made a
head of water. &ldquo;A change having occurred in Mr.
Hawley&rsquo;s business, he spent the winter of 1806 and 1807
in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and not knowing when he
would return to Ontario county, he sketched the first
essay, and to preserve it from oblivion, as he said, he
procured it to be published there, on the fourteenth day
of January, 1807, in the newspaper called the <i>Commonwealth</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Origin

length and joined Boston Harbor at Charlestown with
the Merrimac River. It was incorporated in 1789, begun
in 1790 and opened in 1804. Its cost to 1815 was over
half a million. It was thirty feet wide at the top,
twenty feet wide at the base and three feet deep. The
rise from Boston to summit level was one hundred and
four feet and the descent to the Merrimac, thirty-two
feet. It included twenty locks, seventy-five feet long,
ten feet wide at the base and eleven feet wide at the
top, capable of locking a boat of fourteen tons. The
income from tolls beginning with $7,000 in 1808 had
increased to $25,000 in 1815; land beside the canal had
increased in value one-third, and New Hampshire timber
at once became worth from one to three dollars per
ton standing, which before was worth nothing. The
success of this canal must be considered as having something
to do in the promotion of the Erie Canal.</p></div>

The New York and Erie Railroad was incorporated
in 1832 and in 1836 the legislature authorized a loan
of the credit of the state to the company for the amount
of $3,000,000 subject to certain restrictions, some of
which were that the route of the road should be through
the Southern tier of counties in the state, one-fourth
was to be completed in ten years, one-half in fifteen
years, and the whole of it in twenty years. The road
was to begin at Tappan, Rockland County, on the Hudson,
pass through Goshen, Oswego, Elmira, and other
towns and end at Dunkirk on Lake Erie.&mdash;Tanner,
